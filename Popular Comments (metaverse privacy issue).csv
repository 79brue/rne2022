Society is a much more complex model with so many moving parts that are influenced by human emotions (unlike the weather).

We make very very specific data models to price products based on a small set of data points and most of them blow up as soon as they come into contact with real world data.

            ","So, a little extra bit for people who are curious : systems dynamics models are a bit different than the modern machine learning systems we generally picture today.  they do not have the ability to be trained and learn, instead they are hand built, usually using multiple theories that are then chained together into bigger 'systems'.  The 'historical data' bit is for hand validation, you run known datasets through it and see how well your theory does, then you have to hand make adjustments.  It is still pretty heavily used today since it is much more explainable than ML, but requires a lot more up front work and is not as useful for things like recommendation systems (the core of search, advertising, and product/media browsing) so it gets a lot less attention.","

Many people, not just economists, extrapolated this out to mean that we would eventually run out of things. Later this became known as ""peak oil"" etc.I remember one paper that said we would soon run out of copper because the minimum minable grade was assumed to be 0.1%.
None of this occurred. The '80s were a time a commodity price collapse. This was due to Increased production, tech driven substitution - all the usual things. Prices in real terms have never recovered. Great for us shorts.

            ","This is very interesting, thank you for making that video. One thing I'll point to is, in my opininion, a misconception in ""jet engine vs. donkey"" analogy. Specifically, the idea that our society being more complex makes it more fragile (akin to a jet engine) than ancient societies. Historical study tends to show that the exact opposite is true, ancient societies were incredibly fragile, the loss of a single food source, epidemics, or depleting the local environment, could lead to quick and incredibly deadly collapses, yet those collapses seem almost insignificant in the course of History simply because there just wasn't that much to lose. By contrast, the more complex a society is the more adept it is at weathering blows, the Roman Empire withstood catastrophies that would have brought a less complex society to its knees, and part of what made its fall so memorable and studied is the sheer magnitude of the systemic forces that eventually took it down.

To offer another analogy rather than ""the jet engine"", I would go to biology. Simple organisms versus complex organisms. Ancient, primitive societies might be thought of as unicellular organisms, extremely vulnerable to any single event, but whose ""collapse"" is hardly even noticeable because there is so little to lose. By contrast, our society might be thought of as something like the most complex organism we know of, a human and its brain. We are gifted with an incredible adaptativeness, a strong immune system, we are able to effortlessly weather catastrophies that would have brought less developped societies to their knees...But the magnitude of the challenges we are facing because of our complexity is also unlike anything any other society had to face in History.


Quick and dirty analogy: As a ""brain"" society, we're having a stroke. Our very complexity is starting to wear down on us, and while we're still finding ways to work around the problem, ""rewiring"" to keep functionning around rotten tissue, we're now in a race to do this fast enough before the bleeding cripples us for good. It's not a more optimistic analogy I'm afraid.","

            ","One thing I’m always critical of when it comes to the narrative of societal collapse in many of these predictions is the very same narrative of “Rising from nothing and returning to nothing”. If anything, it’s the opposite. Societies rise from other societies and they return to the societies that claim their legacy. Rome didn’t end with a “great cataclysmic collapse”, nor with the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople; Empires up to today proclaim to be the continuation of Rome, or of empires that came long before them, and to be honest, will probably continue on long after. Empires don’t crumble, they change. A lot of these narratives often forget that evolution doesn’t mean progress, it means change and adaptation.","

            ","One remark I have about efficiency and why it can't solve our problems (with the way we conceive of it now) is that it will inevitably plateau into a logistic curve just like we're starting to see with Moore's Law. Even at maximum efficiency, our growth is unsustainable. In order to hit the goals we need to reach to avoid collapse, we don't need efficient growth. We need efficient de-growth.

Careful deconstruction in advance of collapse and safe replacement with more robust, comprehensive, and sustainable systems is already necessary for things like civil planning. Planned demolition and restructuring is expected. Building collapse is not. We do it every day on the small scale, it is achievable on a large one if we pull apart the processes and compare them, then apply ourselves to the problem.

I think we can do this, but we need to listen to the engineers saying uncomfortable things about the flashing red lights and how to fix them rather than  hoping the engine won't overheat.

Of course this is just speculation, but the concept of that is kind of freaky. The idea on paper sounds cool, but in reality, when the technology finally reaches to where the ultimate use of the Metaverse is here, I think that it may have a strongly negative side affect to people's mental and emotional state. Today's social media already has this affect on a lot of people, but this could take that dial up to 11.

            ","One of my biggest issues, All of this stuff already exists. Meta is making it out that they are coming up with something new and revolutionary, However everything they have promised, pretty much already exists within the VR community. Except not controlled by some large Corporation. There's already games, tools and systems where you can meet people in user created worlds (through just an invite) with user created avatars (literally anything you want), where you can meet, hang out, date, play games, work, do art, almost anything. You can already have Hyper realistic Avatar stood next to some Anime looking Avatar and represent yourself how you choose to. 

So in short, as always, the corporations are trying to monopolize an already existing space and make it out that they are the ones coming up with the idea. Just pulling it into one space where they have absolute control to their own benefit. 
I can see how their funding can really push the VR experience further and especially with the tech create some amazing content, i cannot deny this. The quest 2 is already an incredibly cheap and accessible VR kit which competes with top of the range kits. But i think we've all learned many times what happens and is happening when corporations take control of something and the effect  ethically, morally and psychologically.","

No, we cannot know what the world will look like in 2040. But, by setting up a model, actually implementing it in code,  and running it a number of times (even on a 1980's computer), we have a far better comprehension of what to look out for or how to interpret current trends.

            ","I would like to add that one of the biggest problems is that of distribution, not production. We have more than enough resources for 10 billion people, yet 1/3rd of that starve every year, another 1/3rd live in poverty, and only the remaining 1/3rd live in relative wealth.
Productive output has skyrocketed, but wages have stagnated, meaning we simply can't afford to buy what we produce as much as we used to.

And we produce a lot, in fact, we have a crisis of overproduction in which complex products and resources are allowed to go to waste, or even purposefully destroyed if left unsold. Planned obsolescence only further increases the amount of things going to waste while also sharply increasing pollution. The problem with the MIT report is that it was done in such a way that it does not recognize the fundamental problems of a global Capitalist economy, and thus ignores these problems which absolutely contribute to the metrics they tried to track, and these issues have only multiplied over the years. 

And the sharp increase in production, coupled with the stagnation of wages, and rising inflation means it's becoming harder and harder to support oneself, which naturally makes it twice as difficult to start a family, I would argue this at least contributes further to falling birthrates, because more and more people either simply can't raise a family, or find themselves thrust in poverty trying to do so. With China's decline of birthrates on the other hand imposed by policy which is now backfiring. But if we do not make a fundamental change to our economic mode of production, we will definitely find ourselves moving towards imminent societal collapse within our lifetimes. The signs are already there, in fact. One look at today's news headlines is enough to drive that point home.","

He was not impressed. His problem was not so much the methodology as it was the quality of the data that was used to feed it. Apparently, though not surprisingly, it was woefully poor. And while this problem may have been adddressed in the intervening decades, it will never be solved completely.

Thus, while the precautionary principle might well justify heeding the advice it gives, the model should never be taken as an oracle.","

While the son was racing a track there is a ""ghost"" of the last player that made the best time on the track, and it was his dad. He spent weeks racing his dad but never quite being able to beat his time. One day the son finally bests his fathers stored race time, and moments before crossing the finish line the son slams on the breaks letting his father win the race again. He knew winning would erase his fathers time and replace it with his own. He couldn't bring himself to best his father.

The 1972 Limits to Growth (LTG) study was written by engineers and experts in ""system dynamics."" LTG was a forecast of our planets economic future over the period 1972-2040, a forecast that omitted two huge elementary economic facts. When the price of a resource rises, we humans tend to find:
* new sources for the resource (the supply of the resource increases);
* ways to economise on the resource (demand for the resource declines), including finding cheaper substitutes for the resource.
Economists reviewing LTG 50 years ago made this point 50 years ago, and those reviews explain why citations to LTG largely ended by, say, 1985. This video is probably the first time I have seen LTG mentioned this century.","

Microsoft has an advantage in that they have great intellectual property to include in their metaverse if they wanted to. Microsoft’s metaverse would resemble more of the Ready Player One metaverse than what Facebook could do, simply because you’d have familiar video game characters and environments that players can play alongside with! But the way video games have been built and are continuing being built, just doesn’t support a metaverse. It just doesn’t work that way. Microsoft would have to build from scratch for a platform and really plan out the experience because once you start, there’s no going back or redesigning from the ground up. So Facebook has the advantage there. Apple might actually be the underdog and black swan of this industry because they’ve been secretly working on their own VR headset and OS called RealityOS for YEARS!

            ","This is gonna be a looooong read but probably important for some of the younger audience
I can see the potential of the metaverse in tomorrow's society. Especially the part about ""teleportation"", as it will provide an outlet for several groups of people to experience the world in a new way. Inability to travel? No need...you can do it online. But and this is a huge one...no amount of internet and virtual reality will replace the real world. It can't and it shouldn't. Life isn't perfect and it shouldn't be. Life should have ups and downs, highs and lows in order to experience it fully. People should go out, meet people, get loved, get betrayed. Because that is how they know they are alive. If you are stuck behind a screen or headset, stuck in a world that revolves around what pleases you, you will never have those experiences. Moreover, no amount of teleportation will take away from real travelling. I know that it can be problematic but those few moments where you pose with your friends/family in front of the Niagara Falls or Skogafoss (i think i butchered the name) or that memory of you getting caught in the rain and findin that wonderful restaurant by mistake...those cannot be replaced. 
And on another much more serious note...social media have made us distant from our friends and families. We spent hours upon hours on our phones instead of having a real conversation. I, myself, am guilty of this sometimes, especially now during covid and i communicate a lot more with friends that i would otherwise be meeting. Such a level of distance, where you can phase out in a virtual world, if you don't like being with your friends and family in the moment, will bring our society to an end. Creating this perfect life online will make us hate our real lives. Just imagine what happens at the moment to teenagers because of instagram. They are so unhappy with their lives that some of them fall into depression or, worse, commit suicide. All because of social media and the comparison between our lives and those of other's. Imagine what would happen when you realise that your real life sucks compared to your virtual one. You will want to spent more time there, while letting go of your real life. No exercise, malnourishment (if any nourishment). 
You can not quit social media. You will not cease to exist, but communication with people is not always easy and they make it simple. But do not get sucked into this madness and whatever you use, do it with caution and with a sense of measure. Invest in experiences, not virtual consumable stuff that will likely leave no trace of existence after you use them, leaving you empty. Play videogames with your friends online or by inviting them to your house. Start a conersation about their lives, their wants, needs and dreams. Travel if you can, fly a kite in the middle of the day just because if you so want to, watch a movie with your loved ones, read a book, make memories, live in the moment!","

            ","I agree that Meta and social networks can generate serious problems, but I could not help feeling that this report wanted to manipulate me emotionally and that it was sensationalist, trying to make superficial connections of grotesque facts with Facebook, without really defining and addressing what the problem with social networks actually is. I think it only managed to generate a visceral and superficial sense of alarm, but it didn't really define the problem and talk about possible solutions.
In my opinion, social networks are a tool; and we should understand them that way so that we talk about their potential benefit and risks in a balanced way. At this point, almost all of us are using these tools, to socialize, educate ourselves, and work. We can't just talk about this topic in a dichotomous way; we need a more critical discussion.
And I don't want to be misunderstood, of course, we need more and better regulation! But to find the best ways to regulate these tools we need a more critical, less superficial discussion.","

- The best way to understand metaverse is to experience it (by not experiencing reality, ya know)
- You can do almost anything you can imagine in the metaverse - get together with friends, work, learn, play, etc. (oh wait that reminds me of something - ahh, yes...reality)

This whole metaverse thing sounds like the new best drug around the block and to be honest, Facebook already is another such one. 
So Metaverse is a new form of escapism and addiction for those that don't want to face reality in its full brilliance because they just can't handle it.

            ","Going through many of these comments and I'm feeling quite distressed by the lack of understanding of how this model works and the way SD (System Dynamics) works in general.

It is too easy to dismiss this as a cooked model, even though nearly 40 years of data shows our civilization to be tracking nicely along one of the less desirable outcomes._x000D_
 
I think one of the things that is missing here, from both the video and much of the discussion, is what exactly a limit means. Take the limit of the speed of light for example. A vehicle that is bound to special relativity cannot just keep accelerating to the speed of light at a constant rate (in the outside inertial frame of reference) and then suddenly stop accelerating when it reaches c. Instead it will appear to accelerate slower and slower because of feedback caused by relativistic effects.  Likewise, things like population and industrial output cannot keep growing indefinitely in a civilization that is earth bound. If you think growth can continue indefinitely in a finite world, then you are either a madman or an economist (as said by an actual economist). As we approach the limits, likewise real physical feedbacks take hold that will slow the growth.  What that looks like in reality on-the-ground no one can say for sure, especially those who made the world 3 model, as the model itself represents (and handles) quantities like pollution in a very aggregated high-level view. While true the modelers never forecasted (or would have forecasted) climate change or its affects, it could still be regarded as part of the metric of ever increasing pollution. _x000D_
 
In the ""30 Year Update"" the World 3 modelers addressed many of the criticisms including the notion that markets and technology will somehow save the day. Going back to the notion of limits, they point out that limits cannot be abolished, they can only be moved. Each move requires an expenditure of resources and the new limit will push back even harder than the one before. Growth, the kind of growth we are dealing with, is exponential and that means with ""ceteris paribus"" each time a limit gets moved we hit the new limit sooner than we hit the last. Each improvement gets more difficult and more costly while providing less return, all the while the demand keeps rising. Now imagine there are multiple limits all interdependent. To move limit C, you need to do more of B. To do more of B, you also need to do more of A. And you cant do more of A because you are coming against limit C. To cite the ""30 Year Update"" directly:  ""In most World 3 runs [...] the world system does not totally run out of land or food or resources or pollution absorption capability. What it runs out of is the ability to cope.""_x000D_
 
If you are skeptical of what's in this video or the Gaya Herrington take or just want to know more, I strongly recommend reading the ""30 Year Update"" to learn more about what the authors actually said and what they were trying to explain using the World 3 model.","

            ","I think this is a really interesting study, although I have a major issue with what you said and the chart at 2:37 about living in one of the most peaceful periods in human history, as this ignores a lot of factors. Additionally, you referenced all of human history and then showed a chart that only goes back 80 years. 
-The first issue is you created a direct correlation with armed conflict and peace. An absence of armed conflict does not equate to peace as there are many other factors that can prevent peace such as social conflicts (racism, sexism, segregation), domestic unrest (such as crime, violence and corruption), and political and religious divisions. 
-Another issue is that war takes more forms than physical conflict. In the modern world war most commonly takes the form of cyber and economic warfare. Instead of open warfare we see proxy wars and terrorism. 
-The apparent decrease in physical warfare is also not necessarily an indication that the world as a whole has become more cooperative. Never before in human history has any nation or kingdom had the power to destroy the entire planet, now there are many such nations. Historic wars were to gain territory and conquer enemies, but today the entire world has been colonized and you cannot conquer any nation without upsetting somebody who is capable of destroying everything. So wars have declined because we are in a stalemate of sorts. Nobody gets along, but nobody is willing to make the first move because it will always end with everybody losing. The term for that is Mutually Assured Destruction. Instead, the superpowers fight in proxy wars and sabotage so that they can poke at and irritate the enemy while denying involvement to avoid a direct attack. 
War has not gone away, it has just changed form and is restricted by it's own destructive power. That does NOT mean that the world is more peaceful now.","

            ","We need to stop the expansion and proliferation of all these internet platforms. The imminent dangers are obvious, but when you dig further into it, it's real dangers are frightening. All these ""advancements"" need more data, more bandwidth, more storage, and this means more and bigger data centres and servers, backend infrastructures and more. All these consume massive amounts of resources and electricity, an amount that renewable energy is currently still unable to meet, let alone the energy mankind needs for just the basics of daily living.  This will only negate our efforts of reversing climate change and accelerate the death of planet earth, the only place that's capable of supporting human life.","

            ","It's an amazing idea in theory but in reality I know the cons outweigh the pros. For one like you mentioned we won't care about our bodies as much because our virtual avatars will be a ""better"" us one that can be more representative of how we see ourselves or rather want society to see ourselves. The physical world would likely become more boring and run down because we care more about the virtual one. And the biggest thing to me is how can you trust what you see and hear is real, it could so easily be manipulated because it already isn't real, see someone harassing someone well that could be deleted and no evidence would be left (though on the other side it may be easier to escape from that situation). Misinformation would be so much easier to create with the virtual world being already fake. Like to me it's just so scary one company would have the power to manipulate what you see and hear, and when this becomes your life well then that's just such a crazy thing to be able to abuse.","

My conclusion is not a moralistic one about who is right or wrong, admirable or selfish, a good guy or a bad guy. My conclusion is instead a prediction, based on what I have seen happening in the past. Businesses have changed when the public came to expect and require different behavior, to reward businesses for behavior that the public wanted, and to make things difficult for businesses practicing behaviors that the public didn't want. I predict that in the future, just as in the past, changes in public attitudes will be essential for changes in businesses' environmental practices.”_x000D_

It’s only less known as it’s been not as widely adopted yet because of the costs associated with getting these apps running in multiple headsets concurrently at scale (be that over the cloud or between multiple headsets/PCs in the same room). Even then, as amazing as VR can be - it’s needing the motive to make use of it too - Education, Work, Conferencing, Church and meeting people without borders has all been made possible - but not everything has to be virtual.","

            ","Even though all these sounds like an episode of Black mirror, we have to understand that no amount of virtual reality can ever overpower the actual physical reality unless the VR has the power to change/modify the physical reality. Let's say for example if you are hungry, virtual food doesn't satisfy your hunger. You need real food (So does the entire ecosystem associated to facilitating it). Another good example would be a medical emergency. If somebody had a heart attack, no VR treatment can save the person if there is no physical treatment. So I wouldn't worry about actual jobs being taken away. We would still need gardeners, doctors, farmers, architects etc. and we would also need everything we have physically today. It will only exist as a social media platform with VR capability and people are not going to be using it 24x7... But I am worried about the psychological impact this platform may create because of the power it offers and how that's going to affect the mental health of people in real life and our future society at large...","

I worry that just like the job market requiring you to have social media and use it, businesses looking to shove products and services down our throats..metaverse WILL be forced on us. I fear that the future generation will become social zombies and psychopaths and no one will have any bearings that if we don't do something now any effort in the future will become too little too late. We need to band together boycott social media. organize and work diligently to not only educate others but work as hard as mark is at reversing this catastrpohe.

            ","There is an assumption that this will follow some smooth curve across all societies (assuming society as a singular).  I don’t think you can use this in a singular sense and thus more than likely there will be uneven punctuated collapses of societies (plural).  This will lead to more immigration (the economic immigrants, the climate change immigrants, the war taxed immigrants, etc) and thus more uneven punctuations in collapse based on these population shifts and taxing of those resources in the new emigrated areas.  Uneven health care and effects by more pandemics (big and small), pollution (unevenly distributed or at least the affects from pollution) etc. will create larger shifts in a society (singular) causing further uneven punctuations even within in singular societies.  Thus, what I think this means is that life will get more uncomfortable for some (even in modern societies) and far more comfortable for others in that same society.  So, I think being a king (like an Elon Musk) in this future will actually be better than it is now while a middle class suburbanite will be far worse (even if only separated by less than 10 miles geographically).  I don’t know we can view modern society collapses through the same lens as the collapses of past civilizations.  Like global warming, we are already seeing collapses of societies and uneven distribution as to how individuals in those societies are affected by these circumstances.  We don’t have to wait until 2040, it is happening (unevenly and in punctuated ways) in 2021.","
