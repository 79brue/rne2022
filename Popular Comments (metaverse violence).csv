- Watch in full screen
- Zoom out fully (it starts slightly zoomed in)
- Watch in 4k. If you don't, the quality will be a bit shitty because at any given moment you're just watching a section of the 4k video because it's just a 4k video mapped onto a sphere basically
- Use a stereo/surround speaker system, sounds should be fixed in 3d space when you rotate/look around which sounds epic

Think about project NERA, and the attempts by several tech companies to work together to create a closed off ""walled-garden"" internet that they have complete control over.

            ","The conceptual problem with a ""Metaverse,"" open-source or not, is the same thing that afflicts the idea of the 'free' market; given any closed-system game, there are necessarily limited resources. As such, sooner or later, disparity emerges. Ultimately, somebody gets to own. 

Facebook (which we should be honest about, so let's admit up front that it started out as a seedy 'rate these chicks' site) is cutting to the chase by trying to be the first one to plant its giant corporate flag on this new, untouched frontier. It's another intellectual property gold rush. But as a new medium, this one's even more dangerous to the consumer than usual, because it has the potential to substantively decrease what is already near stagnant productivity, and further, it will cause even more frivolous spending in a people who are already in financial debt to their superfluous technologies. More servers will hum away burning fossil fuels so that Facebook may grow fat beyond control selling imaginary adornments for silly avatars to wear as they sit on their imaginary (yet purchasable) couches, all as their users shirk even more of their IRL responsibilities from their IRL couch. Granted, these threats to productivity were also voiced with emerging media of the past, as noted in the video. But those were different media, with different circumstances; though the past may have its patterns, it is fallacious to assume that disparate events of the past necessarily have predictive value concerning the future: that's the Gambler's fallacy. Causality notwithstanding, of course, pedant. 

Do yourself and the rest of us a favor, and stay away from the ultra-marketed enticements of this new technology until it really does become open-source enough to be beyond investors' influence. Those of us old enough to remember computing before Microsoft and Google had dominated the platform by completely eliminating their competition should recognize the smell of rotten once ripe. The once-empowering tool has now become a pay-to-play, with the concession paid to us in the few unlikely collaborative efforts which have managed to survive the burn, like Wikipedia. With any luck, Zuck's new tech toy will turn out to be a Nintendo Virtual Boy, putting this poor excuse for a visionary in a position of having just received his first real-time eye-poke, and maybe we'll be able to push back complete dystopian dejection for at least another generation.

That's not selfishness to say it, kids. Nor is it hopeless cynicism; it is a sober awareness that we're over the hump mathematically now, and that bad times are coming. To state it as such is a clear assessment of ecology, and of economy. The standard of life that we were lucky enough to know will soon dissipate. Here we see a preemptive move to strategically acquire what will be our surrogate for a better world: they're already preparing to sell you a pre-packaged escape experience from your awful reality. At least we can still delay what's coming, though. Stop wasting. Be mindful; stay skeptical, and pay attention. And most of all, remember that everything you buy is your (real) vote.","

People who make metaverses only want to create some kind of a gameified crypto marketplace that they can suck all your money in. Just look at how they advertise their products. Even the most gold-digging gaming company doesn't advertise their games primarily with microtransactions, because they understand that people won't pay money for games they don't enjoy. This is the difference.
Gaming was born so people could have fun, then they added monetization, which allowed developers to make bigger and more enjoyable games. Metaverse was born so multi-billion dollar company can suck your wallet and it will never become fun, at least with companies like Facebook.","

That leaves behind a tiny group of wealthy tech fetishists who have zero aesthetic sensibilities, zero creativity, and zero desire to do anything that might offend one of the many major corporations that have camped out in the metaverse. In other words, it's a $10 billion vanity project made almost exclusively for Mark Zuckerberg, his personal social circle, and the people who idolize him as a genius businessman.","

            ","As someone involved in Second Life, there's a few things you should know.  First, it's not really a game but an environment - a platform.  It's a social media platform.  The users are free to do and create whatever they want in their own areas (sims or simulators).  We have fifty shades of fantasy role playing - of all types.  We have puzzle sims, battle sims, dance halls, sims devoted to cough adult themes.  Furry sims.  Christian sims.  Second,  almost everything you see in SL is created by _the users_.  Yep.  You can create your own skins, clothes, items even scripts and animations.  All the tools are either provided or you can get that at little or no cost.  You can then give away or even sell them.  There are places that have classes in scripting, mesh building, creating textures - and they're run by other users and creators.  Builder's Brewery is an awesome group to learn all that stuff.  Most classes are free but they do ask for donations.  And we have huge events that last for days.  Recreate Woodstock except with avatars that look like teddy bears?  We do that.  Fund raise for the American Cancer Society by running laps in a virtual world?  We do that.  Be a vampire in a dark fantasy world?  We do that.  And most of this is without interference from Linden Labs.  Heck, for charity fundraisers they help us out!  And we can look awesome even on ten year old machines.  So suck on that, Zuck.","

            ","So, a little extra bit for people who are curious : systems dynamics models are a bit different than the modern machine learning systems we generally picture today.  they do not have the ability to be trained and learn, instead they are hand built, usually using multiple theories that are then chained together into bigger 'systems'.  The 'historical data' bit is for hand validation, you run known datasets through it and see how well your theory does, then you have to hand make adjustments.  It is still pretty heavily used today since it is much more explainable than ML, but requires a lot more up front work and is not as useful for things like recommendation systems (the core of search, advertising, and product/media browsing) so it gets a lot less attention.","

            ","I was at MIT economics at the time, and I met Prof Forester several times. You have to remember that the 70s were a time of huge commodity price increases. Many people, not just economists, extrapolated this out to mean that we would eventually run out of things. Later this became known as ""peak oil"" etc.I remember one paper that said we would soon run out of copper because the minimum minable grade was assumed to be 0.1%.
None of this occurred. The '80s were a time a commodity price collapse. This was due to Increased production, tech driven substitution - all the usual things. Prices in real terms have never recovered. Great for us shorts.

I think it's also kinda gross that the critics who state ""necessity is the mother of invention"" is how we're going to solve these issues. Thing is they're not wrong, humans as whole are notorious for ignoring problems until they're actually threatening something personal to them, it's just the apathetic attitude behind it that's gross.","

TVs and smartphones at least have the commonality of being 2D, but being in a 3D world which plays on entirely different senses and parts of your brain, with the potential of you spending hours and hours and hours in it, will definitely have some adverse psychological effects. Mobile devices and the internet already have questionable effects on our psyches but this would surely be worse like......dissociative disorder/schizophrenia levels of worse. I do definitely agree tho that the worst part of all about this is that it wouldn't be a free metaverse, but just the further consolidation of corporate power over our lives and the privatisation of everything we participate in.","

            ","This is very interesting, thank you for making that video. One thing I'll point to is, in my opininion, a misconception in ""jet engine vs. donkey"" analogy. Specifically, the idea that our society being more complex makes it more fragile (akin to a jet engine) than ancient societies. Historical study tends to show that the exact opposite is true, ancient societies were incredibly fragile, the loss of a single food source, epidemics, or depleting the local environment, could lead to quick and incredibly deadly collapses, yet those collapses seem almost insignificant in the course of History simply because there just wasn't that much to lose. By contrast, the more complex a society is the more adept it is at weathering blows, the Roman Empire withstood catastrophies that would have brought a less complex society to its knees, and part of what made its fall so memorable and studied is the sheer magnitude of the systemic forces that eventually took it down.

To offer another analogy rather than ""the jet engine"", I would go to biology. Simple organisms versus complex organisms. Ancient, primitive societies might be thought of as unicellular organisms, extremely vulnerable to any single event, but whose ""collapse"" is hardly even noticeable because there is so little to lose. By contrast, our society might be thought of as something like the most complex organism we know of, a human and its brain. We are gifted with an incredible adaptativeness, a strong immune system, we are able to effortlessly weather catastrophies that would have brought less developped societies to their knees...But the magnitude of the challenges we are facing because of our complexity is also unlike anything any other society had to face in History.


Quick and dirty analogy: As a ""brain"" society, we're having a stroke. Our very complexity is starting to wear down on us, and while we're still finding ways to work around the problem, ""rewiring"" to keep functionning around rotten tissue, we're now in a race to do this fast enough before the bleeding cripples us for good. It's not a more optimistic analogy I'm afraid.","

If anything, it’s the opposite. Societies rise from other societies and they return to the societies that claim their legacy. Rome didn’t end with a “great cataclysmic collapse”, nor with the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople; Empires up to today proclaim to be the continuation of Rome, or of empires that came long before them, and to be honest, will probably continue on long after.

            ","As someone who works in VR (as a game animator), all I can say is that is a great analysis. I don't see VR becoming a widespread phenomenon, but rather a thing people like to play from time to time. Nobody in my team plays VR for fun every day and nobody I know does. It's too demanding. Though many people are getting into it, it's more of a curiosity than a real appeal. Some like to do their sport on it, some like to have fun with rhythm games. But nobody in their right mind would stay in for more than 2 hours at a time. VRchat users aren't in their right minds.

There's also a major problem for me (and for us as a company) : the Quest, as great a piece of tech as it is, is no more powerful than a flagship smartphone, leaving us to deal with problems and limitations dating back to the PS2. That's not a joke. It's impossible to make good looking games that don't look like polygon soup, the headset wouldn't handle that.","

Elated, I scrambled to it so I could claim it.  I picked it up, and while admiring it, a shadowy blue figure emerged from behind some foliage and with a violent smack, knocked me to the ground.  Helpless, I laid there dying, watching in horror as he crouched repeatedly over my face, sexually assaulting my virtual corpse over and over.

I don't remember the specifics of what kind of business, I think it was that he and a team on Second Life had gotten the CEO of an energy company to agree to join a virtual meeting on the site, which was definitely less common then. They really had to persuade the CEO to give the virtual meeting a shot, the dude was definitely the type to keep things ""old school"". Anyway, he agreed. the day of the meeting arrives, everyone had their virtual look-alikes ready to go in the virtual conference room, the CEO was there, they were just waiting on one more guy from the pitch team to show up. When he finally showed up, rather than an avatar that looked like him in real life, it was a furry character. Something kind of like Silvester the Cat. This was for a legitimate business meeting that had nothing to do with furries lol. The CEO had already expressed discomfort with the virtual setting, but that guy showing up as a furry character was the last straw, and he decided to just leave, saying it was too much and he wasn't going to listen to their pitch at all. My dad asked the team member what the fuck he was thinking and the response was roughly ""I just needed to express myself"".","

            ","It feels like most forced corporate memes end up pushing through eventually and becoming mainstream, just as they wanted, or that corps play catchup in that ""Hey, fellow teens!"" kinda way. But the absolute rejection of the Metaverse is a truly, truly beautiful thing. It's so loaded with a distinct brand of corporate cringe and clearly doesn't compete with other similar platforms on many levels. A friend of mine was telling me about the seedier side of VRChat that she got into, full body vr tracking lapdance and sex clubs n shit. Zuck is open about being inspired by Snowcrash, which I haven't read but to my understanding its own Metaverse is a truly programmer driven, user generated content driven platform. VRChat has that kind of wild west feeling. Yeah it's somewhat moderated but it really isn't hard to find some crazy shit in there. Same went for Second Life. Same goes for fuckin World of Warcraft. Goldshire Inn night elf ERP fresh out of the human spawn anyone? I feel like Zuck's metaverse would have an aneurysm at the mere thought of a titty or a heavy cuss word, let alone the actual sight of them. 

People wanna get weird. People wanna be Ugandan knuckles. People wanna give and receive virtual lap dances for some reason. People wanna be anime catgirls. Nobody wants to be in a dry, artless, milquetoast, badly designed and unfun virtual platform of any kind, VR or not.

To say nothing of the infrastructure simply not being there in the foreseeable future, the copyrights alone render it impossible.  Modders were getting C&D for porting Master Chief to Skyrim...does anyone really think that Disney will be okay with someone buying an NFT and playing as Mickey in Doom?  It'd be hilarious, but Disney would have a fit.  In the broader sense, I see nothing of value that could be gained, especially with the current marketing mindset.

We need more neuroscientists in this debate and less of these transhumanist fools who think they know what consciousness is and how it will work (the mind is not computational as Roger Penrose has pointed out and he has been researching this for decades). Does anyone know the short or long term effects of VR on cognition, memory and perception. Maybe you should start looking in to that. New tools and technologies are always welcome: but we need to understand ourselves  better before thinking that some new technology is going to be the solution.","

            ","One remark I have about efficiency and why it can't solve our problems (with the way we conceive of it now) is that it will inevitably plateau into a logistic curve just like we're starting to see with Moore's Law. Even at maximum efficiency, our growth is unsustainable. In order to hit the goals we need to reach to avoid collapse, we don't need efficient growth. We need efficient de-growth.

Careful deconstruction in advance of collapse and safe replacement with more robust, comprehensive, and sustainable systems is already necessary for things like civil planning. Planned demolition and restructuring is expected. Building collapse is not. We do it every day on the small scale, it is achievable on a large one if we pull apart the processes and compare them, then apply ourselves to the problem.

I think we can do this, but we need to listen to the engineers saying uncomfortable things about the flashing red lights and how to fix them rather than  hoping the engine won't overheat.

We are acutely aware of the limitations of a virtual world and staking real money on virutal economies, because we've been doing it for years. 

Seeing everyone crazy about a virtual universe existing on top of our physical one gives us confusion, because it begs the question as to whether the people running this craze have ever heard of an MMO. Seeing ""Play to Earn"" bragged about as a good thing confuses us, because we know from experience that ""Play to Earn"" gamers are the lowest scum in our community; they are our gold farmers, our scammers, our rank boosters.

We are not behind the times. We've been there before you. And our answer is no.","

            ","Even old school runescape with it’s 2007-level basic graphics is infinitely more appealing than this metaverse garbage. Shows how badly they visually designed a 2022 “game”.  What makes something like OSRS or other MMO fun is the mutual challenge imo. In metaverse, you what, literally just stand there and exist? Play surface level games instead of any actual PC game out there today? The ONLY thing that might be interesting is some kind of community theatre to watch a show with friends or other fans of a movie or something. Besides that, it is pointless.","

            ","The part of ""allowing NO user made content"" is killing metaverse. The part that made VRChat and other games like it so good is user made content. For example in IMVU i made a few shirts but another person made them but better theirs's sold more than mine did. VRChat has a similar system that you can upload your own 3D models just the user doesn't have to pay for it unless they want to go with a paid model. Nexon tried it with MapleStory 2 and it kind of worked for them. Second Life did it with their game it is going on 18 years old now. 

User made content is the way to keep your program alive when it is all about people talking with on another. User made content is how chat room like software keeps alive. It is also how the software can take off or not. The image made lots of ppl talk about it but not in a good way.","

            ","This whole ""Metaverse"" thing is having a negative impact on my enjoyment of VR and the VR gaming community. They've renamed their oculus quest series to ""Meta Quest"", and so many of the ""new"" apps on the Oculus store are just the same meeting app released 100 times. It feels like browsing the wii shop channel where everything sucks. 

The Oculus store used to be incredibly curated. Games that were designed to make use of the quests unique hardware, and not allowing just anyone to create a game like Steam (not that that's bad obviously), but it feels like it's been taken over by some exec who for some reason thinks that if they just release 11 VR meeting apps instead of 8 then it will suddenly become successful.

The Oculus quest is really cool because it's affordable, has some great games, it's completely wireless, but if they keep trending in this direction I'm just going to save up for a Valve Index, because whatever they do I know that at the end of the day they care about games, not trying to own the universe.","

Corporation with infinite resources will never be able to match a genuine human person when it comes to producing entertainment art such as a video game because corporations cannot compute essence. Corporations go for what they predict is going to produce the highest number of participants with the least number of complaints, as a result their formula for entertainment is always the same, stale, soulless. It's stripped bare of any essence that would make the content engaging on a personal level with the player, they have to compensate by using predatory means such as gambling mechanics and FMO tactics to keep the mentally gullible engaged with the product. An artist understands that different people enjoy different things and that you will never ever be able to create something that appeals to everyone, an artist picks their audience and creates a master work that appeals to that specific audience, people who are into that stuff will play the game because to them it is just good, not because they are coerced into it.

Now, AI can do many things, and there is plenty of training data in terms of images, text and audio. What other training data could be useful?
Now, imagine a device that would track movement, facial expressions, voice and many others in the context of natural conversations with multiple people, without the people being aware this data would be collected. If there's a huge demand for this kind of training data for AI, it would make sense to try to make some profit from it.

            ","VR enthousiast hereFun fact about Facebooks metaverse: it is being laughed at real hard by the VR community. People play boneworks, vrhcat, neosvr and ChilloutVR with fullbody this is the metaverse we want and already have. Customizable avatars easily  uploaded to these games and social vr platforms. NeosVR is a developers fucking fever dream because of how in depth it is and what you can create with code you can create while in VR (I'm not kidding NEOSVR can be nuts).

 VRChat is seen as the social platform with chilloutvr being treated like the bing of vr social platforms which honestly they don't deserve but still it exists as a competitor. They have full body implementation and face and eye tracking. Vrchat has minigames and other things while you're there. You can look at your avatars with mirrors within worlds.

The metaverse of facebook came late and is still laughed at mainly because of it having no legs and mainly the minigames making you apparently nauseous. They don't understand VR or the VR community. Barely any choice with your avatar and more issues.

Vrchat has parties, raves, DJ's, the biggest virtual connections in the world. 

Facebook always will be a joke here because of what we currently have and what we want.","

I think it would be interesting to pull together some datasets to gain a more insightful picture.  Correlation is not causation, especially for extrapolations like this.  Basically this simulation is just loaded with assumptions.  Digging deeper into the variables may uncover all kinds of interesting patterns.  Simulations are interesting.

May I point out,  especially to the many critics commenting here below, modelling (whether crude or sophisticated), is never in the first place about predicting a particular outcome with exact or fair accuracy, but it is about fundamentally UNDERSTANDING the driving mechanisms and interacting dependencies  of the phenomena. 

No, we cannot know what the world will look like in 2040. But, by setting up a model, actually implementing it in code,  and running it a number of times (even on a 1980's computer), we have a far better comprehension of what to look out for or how to interpret current trends.  

In fact, all understanding by any human mind, is just a set of models created inside that mind.","

            ","I would like to add that one of the biggest problems is that of distribution, not production. We have more than enough resources for 10 billion people, yet 1/3rd of that starve every year, another 1/3rd live in poverty, and only the remaining 1/3rd live in relative wealth.
Productive output has skyrocketed, but wages have stagnated, meaning we simply can't afford to buy what we produce as much as we used to.

And we produce a lot, in fact, we have a crisis of overproduction in which complex products and resources are allowed to go to waste, or even purposefully destroyed if left unsold. Planned obsolescence only further increases the amount of things going to waste while also sharply increasing pollution. The problem with the MIT report is that it was done in such a way that it does not recognize the fundamental problems of a global Capitalist economy, and thus ignores these problems which absolutely contribute to the metrics they tried to track, and these issues have only multiplied over the years. 

And the sharp increase in production, coupled with the stagnation of wages, and rising inflation means it's becoming harder and harder to support oneself, which naturally makes it twice as difficult to start a family, I would argue this at least contributes further to falling birthrates, because more and more people either simply can't raise a family, or find themselves thrust in poverty trying to do so. With China's decline of birthrates on the other hand imposed by policy which is now backfiring. But if we do not make a fundamental change to our economic mode of production, we will definitely find ourselves moving towards imminent societal collapse within our lifetimes. The signs are already there, in fact. One look at today's news headlines is enough to drive that point home.","

            ","The whole quote of “They just don’t get it” by Zuckerberg is a prime example of a corporate leader that completely missed the boat on the basic rule of selling a product. The same failure every high profile person has made trying to push NFTs. Heck, the Wii U was way more clear about what benefits it was supposed to give the user than people explaining what NFTs will really give you, exclusively. And we know how that went. This is probably the most terrible sales pitch I’ve ever seen. The general public can’t see any benefit. It’s still the case, and the whole “They just don’t get it” as a interpretation as a failure of the “public” is actually the other way around. It isn’t a failure on the public, it is a failure of the salesman that the public doesn’t “get it”.

The fact that so many Smart People still can’t sell any benefit this late in the game is a reflection on the idea that maybe there really isn’t anything to sell. For now, to everybody, this is basically Mel Brook’s (Happy Birthday) History of the World Part 1 part of the script where that man says, “Nothing! I have absolutely nothing for sale!”","

I wholeheartedly agree with this video, metaverse is something that is definitely intresting but the way facebook launched it as well as the security issues coupled with the testimonies of former FB employees to the US government makes me feel that Metaverse will suffer from severe security issues.

Also meteverse isn't something revolutionary and isn't going our lives as we have programs like VR chat which are already good and don't have security issues as far I know.

            ","It's true that Facebook's metaverse isn't going to work out the way they want to. I see more people in games like VRChat and ChilloutVR using the provided desktop mode or using a VR headset. Those games have soul that is created by the communities that thrive and create within them. I think Facebook is going about this incorrectly with a sterile and safe version of those social VR games and expecting soul and whatnot to exist inherently rather than working to foster a community of creatives who would be able to apply their talent to give the game soul. However, while a ""Marcus"" in vrchat is definitely something allowed, a ""Marcus"" in Zuckerberg's wild ride would be banned pretty quickly, leaving the game barren and stale. Or full of business people.","

The 1972 Limits to Growth (LTG) study was written by engineers and experts in ""system dynamics."" LTG was a forecast of our planets economic future over the period 1972-2040, a forecast that omitted two huge elementary economic facts. When the price of a resource rises, we humans tend to find:
* new sources for the resource (the supply of the resource increases);
* ways to economise on the resource (demand for the resource declines), including finding cheaper substitutes for the resource.
Economists reviewing LTG 50 years ago made this point 50 years ago, and those reviews explain why citations to LTG largely ended by, say, 1985. This video is probably the first time I have seen LTG mentioned this century.","

            ","I had a chance for a conversation with Jay Forrester, the MIT professor who developed the Dynamo simulation model used in this Limits to Growth study and the supervisor of the graduate students who produced it. He was not impressed. His problem was not so much the methodology as it was the quality of the data that was used to feed it. Apparently, though not surprisingly, it was woefully poor. And while this problem may have been adddressed in the intervening decades, it will never be solved completely.

Thus, while the precautionary principle might well justify heeding the advice it gives, the model should never be taken as an oracle.","

It IS the internet. Like, as it is, now. It’s a way of reinterpreting the internet as is into VR, just like how websites look different between PC and smartphones, but much more extreme
There is no top down control by any company or any authority other than the actual laws of your country, just like the internet
Roblox, VR chat, Horizon worlds, Second Life, these are not metaverses nor can they ever be. Even if a “metaverse” was open source, if it was its one separated platform or app like Roblox, it would still not be a metaverse, at least in how it is viewed by modern people genuinely trying to build it.

            ","The “Metaverse” would definitely have to be built from a new experience. Microsoft has an advantage in that they have great intellectual property to include in their metaverse if they wanted to. Microsoft’s metaverse would resemble more of the Ready Player One metaverse than what Facebook could do, simply because you’d have familiar video game characters and environments that players can play alongside with! But the way video games have been built and are continuing being built, just doesn’t support a metaverse. It just doesn’t work that way. Microsoft would have to build from scratch for a platform and really plan out the experience because once you start, there’s no going back or redesigning from the ground up. So Facebook has the advantage there. Apple might actually be the underdog and black swan of this industry because they’ve been secretly working on their own VR headset and OS called RealityOS for YEARS! It should be announced later this year, but with Apple’s engineering and design team, that beast M1 chip, and Apple Arcade, Music, TV, and apps they already have what they have the advantage on both sides.","

I think it only managed to generate a visceral and superficial sense of alarm, but it didn't really define the problem and talk about possible solutions.
In my opinion, social networks are a tool; and we should understand them that way so that we talk about their potential benefit and risks in a balanced way. At this point, almost all of us are using these tools, to socialize, educate ourselves, and work. We can't just talk about this topic in a dichotomous way; we need a more critical discussion.
And I don't want to be misunderstood, of course, we need more and better regulation! But to find the best ways to regulate these tools we need a more critical, less superficial discussion.","

            ","During the early years, Facebook took off because it created a safe environment for shy people to flirt with people they already knew in real life. At that time, this was unprecedented. When the poke function was first introduced, Facebook's popularity went to the moon pushing its peers to extinction. By the time too many people were ""poking"", it became another dating time waster, but it already had a large user base that was ripe for monetization with ads. The business model only continues to work because FB's user base have matured and no longer rely on it as a quasi dating app. Many from the original crowd have started family and grew old. For FB, it started as an authentic project, and monetization came later, subtle and mildly useful. That authenticity was lost when Zuck's greed allowed political, geopolitical and disinformation ads to run, not to mention the apps that stole users information to manipulate political outcomes. Unlike Facebook in its early authentic years, Metaverse has zero authenticity. It was nothing new. And nobody needs it. It was contrived by Zuck solely on how much money he imagined he could make.","

- The best way to understand metaverse is to experience it (by not experiencing reality, ya know)
- You can do almost anything you can imagine in the metaverse - get together with friends, work, learn, play, etc. (oh wait that reminds me of something - ahh, yes...reality)

This whole metaverse thing sounds like the new best drug around the block and to be honest, Facebook already is another such one. 
So Metaverse is a new form of escapism and addiction for those that don't want to face reality in its full brilliance because they just can't handle it.

Forrester invented them, Sterman is the nowadays guru, they have World 2 and World 3 simulations.

What is more interesting than the “metaverse” itself, is how this has suddenly become such a heavily marketed concept.  Clearly the PR people have done an effective job of getting this out to their targeted demographics.

            ","Going through many of these comments and I'm feeling quite distressed by the lack of understanding of how this model works and the way SD (System Dynamics) works in general.

It is too easy to dismiss this as a cooked model, even though nearly 40 years of data shows our civilization to be tracking nicely along one of the less desirable outcomes._x000D_
 
I think one of the things that is missing here, from both the video and much of the discussion, is what exactly a limit means. Take the limit of the speed of light for example. A vehicle that is bound to special relativity cannot just keep accelerating to the speed of light at a constant rate (in the outside inertial frame of reference) and then suddenly stop accelerating when it reaches c. Instead it will appear to accelerate slower and slower because of feedback caused by relativistic effects.  Likewise, things like population and industrial output cannot keep growing indefinitely in a civilization that is earth bound. If you think growth can continue indefinitely in a finite world, then you are either a madman or an economist (as said by an actual economist). As we approach the limits, likewise real physical feedbacks take hold that will slow the growth.  What that looks like in reality on-the-ground no one can say for sure, especially those who made the world 3 model, as the model itself represents (and handles) quantities like pollution in a very aggregated high-level view. While true the modelers never forecasted (or would have forecasted) climate change or its affects, it could still be regarded as part of the metric of ever increasing pollution. _x000D_
 
In the ""30 Year Update"" the World 3 modelers addressed many of the criticisms including the notion that markets and technology will somehow save the day. Going back to the notion of limits, they point out that limits cannot be abolished, they can only be moved. Each move requires an expenditure of resources and the new limit will push back even harder than the one before. Growth, the kind of growth we are dealing with, is exponential and that means with ""ceteris paribus"" each time a limit gets moved we hit the new limit sooner than we hit the last. Each improvement gets more difficult and more costly while providing less return, all the while the demand keeps rising. Now imagine there are multiple limits all interdependent. To move limit C, you need to do more of B. To do more of B, you also need to do more of A. And you cant do more of A because you are coming against limit C. To cite the ""30 Year Update"" directly:  ""In most World 3 runs [...] the world system does not totally run out of land or food or resources or pollution absorption capability. What it runs out of is the ability to cope.""_x000D_
 
If you are skeptical of what's in this video or the Gaya Herrington take or just want to know more, I strongly recommend reading the ""30 Year Update"" to learn more about what the authors actually said and what they were trying to explain using the World 3 model.","

            ","How, exactly, can a  non existent, virtual avatar be raped?  Are the avatars programmed with  anatomically detailed sexual organs?  Are the avatars able to  remove the clothing from another avatar?  Why in heaven's name would something like that be programmed into the game in the first place?  If it is, then that is reprehensible, and I feel the creators of the game should be made to place restrictions on the game actions. 

Was there no way to move the avatar away from the others,  or to resist or strike back, due to the fact that these are avatars,  computer game pieces, and there is no actual physical restraint involved?  Couldn't you have ""pulled the plug"" on the game and put an end to any action?  You, the human being, always have the option of turning the machines off.  You are not handcuffed or locked into the gaming system against your will---you can escape it at any time, in a single instant.   

I am sorry to break it to you,  boys and girls,  that in any game where there are no rules, no regulations, and no restraints placed on players,  then the ugly side of human nature is certain to show up.  All the more so since in this game, the perpetrators are entirely unknown,  and can suffer no repercussions for their actions. This is the very reason that we have laws and religion in the real world.  

And I beg to differ,  of course human being are guinea pigs for corporations-----that is how businesses determine who their customers will be, and where they can find the largest, most lucrative, customer base.  And there is nothing unusual in businesses launching a program, a new product or any number of other things, and then acting on problems afterward.  

But seriously,  if you are getting to the point where you are mistaking a ""virtual"" computer gaming world for real life,  to the point were you are ""traumatized""  by something that happens to a picture on a computer screen, then you need to dump the electronics,  turn off the computer,  unplug and go outside into the real world where you can re-acquaint yourself with fresh air,  sunshine and real, living people.   If this young lady is having mental heath problems after playing a glorified video game, then I suggest she suffered from mental weakness and instability before she ever touched the equipment.  One is supposed to be able to distinguish between the real world and the fantasy one.    Unless, of course, she is looking to sue the designers for ""damages"".  Greed and cheating are also human nature.","

But when we leave the meta verse we will come back to our messy apartment.

            ","People who think this is newsworthy or even an issue of some kind clearly don't understand anything about technology, online gaming or metaverse.
An avatar can be anything, it doesn't have to be male or female or non binary person, it doesn't have to be identified by gender or species. That is the point of the metaverse, not to be real life but something else where you can be an energy being, or a rock if you want to. And voices can be altered as well, you can sound however you want. 

And to say that someone did something to you that you didn't want, is absolutely absurd. You can log off or even not look at the screen, and voila, nothing is happening.

All adults should be avare of the general toxicity that exists online, and that is nothing new.

People sitting behind a screen are  extremely toxic. So the metaverse will probably not be an exception.

And, to protect children from this new threat, I guess you should just be better parents and actually care about what your child is doing, instead of giving them a device so you can do your own thing and not be bothered. 

Everyone has a problem with the tech but not with their own neglect of the children in their home. 

If you don't set the rules and guidelines for your children, no tech company will do it for you.","

Ever since entertainment companies realised they can turn their customers into essentially tax-payers, it's been the holy grail to attain for any large corporate entities making games, tv etc. It was only a matter of time before someone tried to bring that concept wholesale to blend into a social media platform. 

One particular issue I'd focus on, as there's so many things wrong with this, is how it represents the slow degradation of the capitalist system as a whole (not to sound too dramatic), as the cost of our engagement with entertainment increases while the actual value we receive from it steadily declines as it's parcelled into smaller packages of digital data with no real world value. Taken to its extreme, this is the ultimate dystopian end to the capitalist system where all semblence of providing value to the customer has gone but everything has a cost.","

            ","I think this is a really interesting study, although I have a major issue with what you said and the chart at 2:37 about living in one of the most peaceful periods in human history, as this ignores a lot of factors. Additionally, you referenced all of human history and then showed a chart that only goes back 80 years. 
-The first issue is you created a direct correlation with armed conflict and peace. An absence of armed conflict does not equate to peace as there are many other factors that can prevent peace such as social conflicts (racism, sexism, segregation), domestic unrest (such as crime, violence and corruption), and political and religious divisions. 
-Another issue is that war takes more forms than physical conflict. In the modern world war most commonly takes the form of cyber and economic warfare. Instead of open warfare we see proxy wars and terrorism. 
-The apparent decrease in physical warfare is also not necessarily an indication that the world as a whole has become more cooperative. Never before in human history has any nation or kingdom had the power to destroy the entire planet, now there are many such nations. Historic wars were to gain territory and conquer enemies, but today the entire world has been colonized and you cannot conquer any nation without upsetting somebody who is capable of destroying everything. So wars have declined because we are in a stalemate of sorts. Nobody gets along, but nobody is willing to make the first move because it will always end with everybody losing. The term for that is Mutually Assured Destruction. Instead, the superpowers fight in proxy wars and sabotage so that they can poke at and irritate the enemy while denying involvement to avoid a direct attack. 
War has not gone away, it has just changed form and is restricted by it's own destructive power. That does NOT mean that the world is more peaceful now.","

            ","This is only tangentially related, but my absolute favorite bad take is when Ubisoft was trying to push NFTs in Ghost Recon. There was a massive backlash, and when asked by the Australian financial website Finder about it, Ubisoft's VP at Strategic Innovations Labs said that ""it's not an easy concept to grasp"" and that ""gamers don't get what a digital secondary market can bring to them."" This is how out of touch these morons are. 

We've had ""digital secondary markets"" for two decades now. Gaia Online, Neopets, TF2, CS:GO, and every single goddamn MMO ever. We've learned more about market demand and inflation from these things than we have from school. We know exactly how this shit works, and we know what will happen when corporations try to control ""our"" digital ownership. Zuck has similar delusions. He thinks that his ""Metaverse"" is some innovative thing, but the idiot doesn't realize that these concepts have existed for years and been done better. Then again, considering he made a shitty knockoff of Myspace, I can't be surprised. He doesn't know how to come up with original ideas. 

He also vastly overestimates VR. It's still an expensive, niche hobby for most people and it's not going to have the rapid mass adoption he thinks it will. Gamers are going to look at his shit and point to VR Chat, and normies and businesses are just going to be confused. Why would anyone buy a VR headset to chat to friends or colleagues when they can just use regular Facebook, Zoom or one of the many other alternatives out there? Also I would just like to point out that Facebook is seen as a ""boomer"" thing now, most of Gen Z doesn't even bother with it.

My conclusion is not a moralistic one about who is right or wrong, admirable or selfish, a good guy or a bad guy. My conclusion is instead a prediction, based on what I have seen happening in the past. Businesses have changed when the public came to expect and require different behavior, to reward businesses for behavior that the public wanted, and to make things difficult for businesses practicing behaviors that the public didn't want. I predict that in the future, just as in the past, changes in public attitudes will be essential for changes in businesses' environmental practices.”_x000D_

            ","So... They definitely did NOT spend 10 billion dollars on the interface or assets that we're seeing.  You couldn't sink that much money into developing a low rent version of VR chat if you were specifically trying to waste revenue.  It's pretty clear that all 10 billion dollars went into developing the NFT and crypto mechanics.  All the development time and energy has definitely been directed into figuring out how they can make it possible for people with no tech literacy to participate in NFT and crypto scams without doing anything more complicated than they already do on Facebook.

It's not like we ever needed proof that this whole thing is just Zuckerberg's next grift, but this shows it so clearly.  I think it's likely that virtually no work was done on controls and appearance of the UI until a month or two before launch.  Instead, this has all been about how to link existing Facebook accounts to crypto wallets, and to streamline the process of buying and selling with crypto for the end user.  They need a way to have their own servers handle all the work of the providing proof of work or proof of stake, behind the scenes without grandma having to do anything more meaningful than she already does when purchases microtransactions in whatever clone of Farmville, she's currently obsessed with.  Really hiding everything to do with blockchain transactions behind a smooth, convenient normie proof interface is project that could believable suck up 10 billion.

What really worries me, is that everyone is laughing now, but I'm quite concerned that whatever happens to Zuckerberg or META, the work to sucker ordinary people into the blockchain grift is being done here, and it's only a matter of time before someone controls the structure their creating who also knows how to properly launch a VR chat game.  I don't think we should be laughing.  I think we should be organizing and pressuring our legislatures to block this move before they someone inevitably pulls this off.","

            ","This meta-problem reminds of when Windows released a tablet, decades before Apple did: they had the initial idea, but it had to be better than just making your PC portable (that's what laptops are for, even the mini-laptops had a short lived run). Zucc's problem is that he wants to invade this particular niche and make it ""profitable"" before someone else does (like Snapchat, Instagram and TikTok did things Facebook couldn't before copying them), and this crusade is costing him A LOT because the tech is not quite there yet.

Most people don't have (or even worst, can't afford) an Oculus or are willing to use ""avatars"" for meetings when we already have webcams. Videogames already have immersive worlds that don't need peripherals and the usage of VR is little by little taking off but still very much niche due price, lack of really killer apps and accessibility.","

But seriously: There's hardly any game out there that had a really long development time like this that actually turned out to be amazing in the end.
To me it seems very likely that by the time the Metaverse is ready to launch every single part of it - the graphics engine, the gameplay, the features etc. - will be so ridiculously outdated that they might as well trash the whole project and start over from scratch... especially since it already feels outdated and it's not even halfway done yet.","

            ","As someone who has been an early adopter of technology over the years and I also saw future benefits of things that eventually became normalized, I really struggle to understand where Meta fits in at all.

Zuckerberg claiming that Meta is the future of the internet is a rather sinister claim because he’s only saying it’s the future so long as he’s in control of it, and it’s really to normalize meta across companies which is just an attempt to monopolize Meta into everything and it’s really just about control.

Zuckerberg wants it to where every major company that wants to do business online can only be done through Meta, in other words he’s supplying a platform that companies have to use if they want in on this “future” of the internet. So at its core I agree it’s more about corporate control of the internet and creating a landscape where everyone is dependent on Meta if they wish to interact with the online world.

That’s my two cents on it, I don’t think it’s going to take off, plus the infrastructure isn’t there and you can’t convince the general public to engage with a VR headset to interact with the internet.","

Sure new users will be wowed by the Quest offerings, but don't expect to play AAA games in VR and get a good experience on the Quest. All Facebook is interested in is furthering their business model, which is collecting information on its users. They really don't care about giving you serious VR as long as they can get your information. Also, being a huge company with mega resources, they can market anything they make to sound really good.

I worry that just like the job market requiring you to have social media and use it, businesses looking to shove products and services down our throats..metaverse WILL be forced on us. I fear that the future generation will become social zombies and psychopaths and no one will have any bearings that if we don't do something now any effort in the future will become too little too late. We need to band together boycott social media. organize and work diligently to not only educate others but work as hard as mark is at reversing this catastrpohe. Great things have been done by groups of people coming together BEFORE the internet. We can do this!","

Both were conceptualized centuries ago (hell, the very first car in general was electric!). Both had early rudimentary implementations of the concept using technology that was FAR too primitive to really do it justice. Both ended up with tarnished reputations thanks to the aforementioned (i.e ""electric cars are slow and can't go very far"" and ""VR will make you blow chunks""). Both have recently seen a workable implementation of the concept finally come to life, thanks to technological advances that was actually spearheaded by the smartphone industry.","

            ","There is an assumption that this will follow some smooth curve across all societies (assuming society as a singular).  I don’t think you can use this in a singular sense and thus more than likely there will be uneven punctuated collapses of societies (plural).  This will lead to more immigration (the economic immigrants, the climate change immigrants, the war taxed immigrants, etc) and thus more uneven punctuations in collapse based on these population shifts and taxing of those resources in the new emigrated areas.  Uneven health care and effects by more pandemics (big and small), pollution (unevenly distributed or at least the affects from pollution) etc. will create larger shifts in a society (singular) causing further uneven punctuations even within in singular societies.  Thus, what I think this means is that life will get more uncomfortable for some (even in modern societies) and far more comfortable for others in that same society.  So, I think being a king (like an Elon Musk) in this future will actually be better than it is now while a middle class suburbanite will be far worse (even if only separated by less than 10 miles geographically).  I don’t know we can view modern society collapses through the same lens as the collapses of past civilizations.  Like global warming, we are already seeing collapses of societies and uneven distribution as to how individuals in those societies are affected by these circumstances.  We don’t have to wait until 2040, it is happening (unevenly and in punctuated ways) in 2021.","

            ","There is so much wrong with the metaverse, it's hard to even know where to begin.  Take VR for instance.  I can only think one one very niche genre where VR even has vocal support fanbase as potentially the most immersive way to play, and even within that community there are many that would disagree.  And that very small and specific group is within the sim-racing community.  And then you have to look at why it would be considered so great within that one usage.  And that it recreates and experience you are not likely to ever truly get within real life, that of driving a racing car or even a regular car at extreme speeds.  IE it immerses you in an experience approximating real life, doing something you probably will never be able to truly do, like drive a F1 car and race against other people.

And that highlights the true problem with metaverse.  It's looking to grow to provide an alternative to real life for mundane every day activities.  Why do I need a to have a board meeting in VR when I could either have it in real life or remotely through a zoom like conference app.  The metaverse does nothing to improve or augment real life mundane activities, but would only seeks to replace and monetize them.  It's entirely predatory without providing any real value to the customer.  And pretty much every piece of technology we have today can find it's roots in the imagination of science fiction, even mobile phones.  Virtual worlds were never depicted to replace real ones in SF, and the closest one gets to potential real life replacement is something like the holodeck in Star Trek, which again never really replaces reality, but has functions leisurely and simulation wise to provide value to reality.  And that again links back to why VR is some popularity in Sim Racing, simulation to provide an experience difficult to replicate in reality.

Nevermind, that they also seem to be trying to build this from the ground up without looking to and recruiting from where virtual worlds have already seen success, in games like Minecraft, large MMOs like WoW, popular communication apps like Discord, the popularity of teleconferencing apps, the small VR success within Sim Racing, live service games like Fortnite, and even the popularity of a predatory game like Roblox.  All of these have lessons to learn and development talent to pull from, instead of trying to recreate the wheel.  They aren't bringing anything to the table that evolves any of these, or leads them to a natural point of convergence, in the way say the I-Phone did for mobile phones.","

They want to make a giant leap in matters of the type of data they gather. Worst thing is people will surely give in to all this willingly. Don't get me wrong, this a very cool idea, but coming from a company like Facebook it's likely to have many shady aspects regarding personal privacy and other important things. And other companies are certainly going to copy or get inspired to do their own thing as well. Every new technology comes at a higher cost than the previous one, and people who intend to use it must think about the consequences of introducing this to their lives, both beneficial and detrimental consequences.

Rest assured this is only one platform. A seemingly more complex metaverse, yet there already are, and there will surely be many more to come. As he points out, this is basically an evolution of gaming, but it can, has, and will be used for many other purposes. I still see many generations of development before it can actually mimic real life. But when, not if it does, what will we sacrifice to continue being a part of it.

This video sounds more than usual like a push for an agenda than an analysis (still has the same production quality tho.)



One example before I leave: 
""The world's more peaceful now""

The data shown doesn't indicate peace. It indicates ""battle deaths"", and the main reason for this shift is the shift in the ways we wage wars. 
When in the past wars were waged by armies, against armies, now they're mostly waged by armies against civilians. 

This is first of all more difficult to count, as it's easy to know how many soldiers come back from a battle, and how many don't. In the case of civilians, if a family disappears, you have to be lucky enough to find their friend in a survey to know they died. Now if it's an entire community...

To illustrate this, The Lancet claims that >600 000 violent deaths occurred because of the iraq war alone between 2003 and 2006. Divide this by 4, the number years considered+1, and you get 150 000 deaths per year (we can say from this that at least 1 year between 2003 and 2006 has at least 150 000 deaths.)

This already is more than what the graph claims for any of these years (max of <1/100 000 --> < 70 000 battle deaths), showing that this isn't at all representative of ""peace"". All of these changes to the data I made are big underestimations.

Please correct me if I made a mistake :)","

Microsoft will have an easier time in this regard since a lot of businesses already rely on them for Teams, Office, Windows, etc.  I know I will crap on them in meetings if anyone suggests Meta for VR, augmented reality, etc.","

The software development has just been poor across the board. There is one good application for VR, and that is p*rn. That part of the ecosystem it is doing very well, and has tons of solid development behind it. Games is okay I suppose. As a social platform... no one is going to bother. The lack of refinement with the current Apps and UI on the Quest 2, is a sign of how they well they are going to pull this off. A could go off on the problems with the current platform for normal Apps like YouTube and Amazon Video. And yes it is not comfortable to wear for long term.

Also it has to do with not allowing a small group to control and hinder/hide actual innovation but that's also part of the education bc today 'innovators' are actually taught how to micro-innovate. So we get an iphone every year that's 0.2% better than the last one and cars that get just a few more mpg when we could have holophones that use a tiny holographic projector say on your wrist (they found a large one in I think china from one of our past civs & they are just now figuring out how to make them in mainstream science), and we could have cars that at the very least run on some sort of battery that almost never needs charged and charges almost instantly and the power source could come from the earth itself so we don't need fossil fuels already OR if you really want to innovate we can make zero-point energy devices that use the energy in the space around them so they are effectively limitless energy and the most efficient thing we can conceptualize with our current actual understanding of how the universe/existence works","

With the metaverse it requires an actual program outside of the browser sandbox, that piece of software has driver level access to the entire system, and Facebook will be able to make the software insanely proprietary.    This way we will get to see the worst of DRM we've seen from entities like Sony, won't have the ability to skip ads/engagement features, complete an total access to the system's file system (since PCs have worse permissions systems than even Android), access to camera's that see the entire room the user is in, and future headsets will have every sort of biometric you can fit into a ""fitness watch"" (along with eye tracking, mouth tracking, and similar).

            ","I disagree with MIT’s prediction on food which changes their model significantly. Since the 70’s, much of farming has been automated. Farmers and Ranchers make up only 1.3% of the US population, so a decrease in population shouldn’t affect food much at all. The rest of the world will follow suit with automation as they advance. Our goal for a society should be to automate as much as we can, and fuel it with clean nuclear power.","

            ","This is an interesting way to look at things, and to some extent explains why VR games still feel like they have a ways to go. Not many are backed by big AAA game companies currently and it definitely feels like Meta is pushing for more social, business and productivity applications over gaming.
Yes there are some VR games backed by big companies, but still not even close to PC and consoles. Most VR games still have an experimental/alpha test feel to them like it's great but not quite there just yet and the majority of successful VR titles are either made by indie developers, Meta or Steam at the moment, with a few exceptions of course but they're fairly uncommon. 

Not necessarily saying that's a bad thing, but small Indie developers don't have access to the same resources to produce huge games (with a couple exceptions). I don't personally care which company/companies end up running the VR show but I can't wait for these big developers to start pushing full fledged AAA VR titles. 
One thing's for sure though, with all those huge developers under their belt now, I would be very interested to see what VR content Microsoft can produce if/when that happens. I'd love to try something like Overwatch or WoW in VR. Hearthstone even would be dope lol.

I know quest 2 outsold everything last Christmas but it doesn't feel like it's taken over just yet. At least where I am (UK) I'm the only person I know personally that uses VR right now. (despite my best efforts to get my friends interested)
I look forward to the day VR is as common as a household PC or a games console. I don't think consoles will go out of fashion, I still play PC and console games regularly, but I think VR will take the lead eventually for gaming. Maybe not soon, but eventually.","

But if the UK currently in rubble, struggling even to meet its citizen's basic needs? No. And that No was much stronger pre-Brexit, but remember that Brexit was something the citizens voted for. It wasn't forced upon them by an invading army. So, my answer to ""will society collapse"" is probably in the ballpark of ""No, unless we want it to"".","

Your never going to get everyone to agree upon a single ""metaverse"" platforms like vrchat will always have off shoots and rivals. For instance, neos VR has become a offshoot that has stolen away a niche community away from VRchat never to return to the platform. However you feel about that, its undeniable that similiar things will always happen. And the diversity and competition this encourages is great!
For instance, several amazing and innovative designers have built some great additions to the meta space, but the new iterations and innovations don't come from Microsoft and Meta. They may iterate on the innovation, than they monetize it. That's the biggest thing killing 343 studios (microsofts game dev team). People have forgotten now, but Microsoft almost completely killed minecraft. Microsoft has already killed other IPs like Halo with rampant monotization and a investor first design model. Big monopolies don't create innovation, they buy it than change it and profit off it. 
Most tech giants are no different than Investment firms, investing in other peoples ideas, than finding ways to profit as much as they can off it. Their is no love or passion for tech, only money.","

I preferred PalmOS but I couldn't just say M$ wasn't the other half of the market (Along with Symbian and Blackberry) The problem these companies had was in not migrating their large user base to the next big thing. For example, Windows Phone 7, it was pretty nice to use, look at and it worked. The problem? Well all the applications, tens of thousands worth, that were made for Windows Mobile 6.5 and earlier wouldn't work on WP7. That simply kills adoption. M$ of all companies should know that given the backwards compatibility of Windows proper. Palm made the same mistake with WebOS, Symbian just died and Blackberry similarly didn't adapt. (and Blackberry's worldwide outage doomed them)
I guarantee you that if M$ added a good compatibility layer to WP7 and allowed old functional apps to work it would have been a different story. (same for Palm's WebOS)","

I studied Geology for my BSc, and interestingly there was a module which covered doomsday scenarios (from a geological/natural perspective).

Now wouldn’t it make sense, for schools, universities, and other educational institutes to make it compulsory for modules to be included about doomsday scenarios within their respective fields. E.g. degrees to do with finance and/or business studies: financial collapse doomsdays scenarios, cause and effects etc; Engineering degrees: rates of innovation etc; and so forth. 

If we can start prepping the generations of today and future generations to start thinking about doomsday scenarios and the fact that the world has to come to an end… maybe our civilisation can eek out a few more years.

            ","One thing it did not account for was increasing intelligence. When you start adding artificial intelligence to the model, global average intelligence starts to increase. There was a hidden assumption in the MIT model that intelligence has no effect or remains constant. But when you have systems that are vastly smarter than humans in specific domains (which already exists), then that will have a drastic affect on innovation. Its likely the widespread use of AI will lead to another industrial revolution where AI systems can make decisions many orders of magnitude better than humans. That will lead to huge increases in efficiency and innovation. AI will quite possibly trigger a runaway in innovation in the next 20-40 years. What this also means is that human population will start to matter less and less because they can be replaced by machines. It also means many things that were previously uneconomical like recycling become highly efficient, particularly as resources become more expensive. When you have an AI system that can automatically pick through garbage and sort all of the recyclable items (this already exists), then suddenly recycling becomes much more viable. Any model that does not factor in the exponential effect of AI systems into society will lead to completely incorrect predictions. This doesn't even require any super intelligence, sentient AI. It just requires systems like that already exist--the AI that can beat the best GO player in the world easily, or a system that can answer any jeapordy questions. Even simple AI models, like I mentioned before, that can classify and pick out garbage are going to have a huge impact. They can run 24/7, they don't need healthcare, they don't need food or social security, they don't need housing, and most importantly they only require an initial investment that's becoming cheaper over time.","
