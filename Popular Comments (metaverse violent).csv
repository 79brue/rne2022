- Watch in full screen
- Zoom out fully (it starts slightly zoomed in)
- Watch in 4k. If you don't, the quality will be a bit shitty because at any given moment you're just watching a section of the 4k video because it's just a 4k video mapped onto a sphere basically
- Use a stereo/surround speaker system, sounds should be fixed in 3d space when you rotate/look around which sounds epic

            ","Here to pick at her design bc art design: 
- Overall there’s no personality communicated in her design beyond an attempt to be ‘relatable’ by being trendy. This has the adverse effect of making her feel flat like a badly written young adult fiction protagonist as she has nothing personal about her. She will also become dated as trends change. 
- She doesn’t express. Like at all. You don’t need a character’s mouth to show emotions (look at Gromit) so the mask is no real excuse for that. This just makes her feel more like a robot than a person. 
- Either they need to make her hair less neon or darken her skin tone a tad because everything around her head is too bright. I can’t look at it comfortably. 
- She has no unique silhouette which makes her design seem generic and forgettable. I hate to reference the corporate mouse but you know the shape of Mickey’s head from a glance. She has no stylisations to proportions or anything to add to her silhouette that would make her feel less like a default model they slapped neon hair on. Just adding some lil hair buns or a hair piece would have helped with that. 
Everything about her feels more like a 3d model barbie they dress up than an actual personality, which is what they seem to be marketing her as. Overall it aint it chief. 
If you wanna see some decent designs of fictional musicians go look at Gorillaz","

            ","In terms of her design... it's like, who's the target audience? 
Presumably younger teens. But Polar is basically built to appeal to the Male Gaze at the most basic level. Like, she doesn't have anything about her beyond that. 

So it's creepy and a bit predatory to pretend that ""this is a sentient creature... and she 'choose' to make herself as much of a sexual object as possible. That's what's cool, good and desirable: she's an influencer, after all! You want to be like her, right teens?""

So yeah, just more pressure on teens to (if they're female) mould themselves to fit this objectifying style, or, if they're male, they're being pressured into accepting ""this is what you like. This is how women are""... regardless of what that young man thinks or feels.

Also, it's lazy, because no thought has gone into her design beyond ""sex and steal Miku's hair"".

So yeah, it's a shitty design that taps into people's id and targets teen insecurity, whilst also being a copyright violation.","

Most Vocaloid songs out there weren't made by a corporation, they were made by real, everyday people just doing something they love, and there's a lot of beauty in that you don't really get to see anywhere else.

People who make metaverses only want to create some kind of a gameified crypto marketplace that they can suck all your money in. Just look at how they advertise their products. Even the most gold-digging gaming company doesn't advertise their games primarily with microtransactions, because they understand that people won't pay money for games they don't enjoy. This is the difference.
Gaming was born so people could have fun, then they added monetization, which allowed developers to make bigger and more enjoyable games. Metaverse was born so multi-billion dollar company can suck your wallet and it will never become fun, at least with companies like Facebook.","

She's very ""grown-up"", but in a way that's clearly meant to be consumed by children. And given the way this company seems to market almost exclusively to children with their other brands, it seems more than likely this was the goal.

            ","As someone involved in Second Life, there's a few things you should know.  First, it's not really a game but an environment - a platform.  It's a social media platform.  The users are free to do and create whatever they want in their own areas (sims or simulators).  We have fifty shades of fantasy role playing - of all types.  We have puzzle sims, battle sims, dance halls, sims devoted to cough adult themes.  Furry sims.  Christian sims.  Second,  almost everything you see in SL is created by _the users_.  Yep.  You can create your own skins, clothes, items even scripts and animations.  All the tools are either provided or you can get that at little or no cost.  You can then give away or even sell them.  There are places that have classes in scripting, mesh building, creating textures - and they're run by other users and creators.  Builder's Brewery is an awesome group to learn all that stuff.  Most classes are free but they do ask for donations.  And we have huge events that last for days.  Recreate Woodstock except with avatars that look like teddy bears?  We do that.  Fund raise for the American Cancer Society by running laps in a virtual world?  We do that.  Be a vampire in a dark fantasy world?  We do that.  And most of this is without interference from Linden Labs.  Heck, for charity fundraisers they help us out!  And we can look awesome even on ten year old machines.  So suck on that, Zuck.","

            ","The fact that Polar feels so hollow and generic literally set her up for failure immediately. Why she feels that way is obvious— she's a simple marketing tactic and money grab. She feels hollow, because there was no true artistic intent involved in her original concept or creation, and even in the song writing.

Part of the reason why Miku is so popular is because of how versatile the concept of a ""voicebank"" is; anyone has access to it and can create what they want. This creates a community of independent artists free of any limits that would be put into place if associated with companies or the like. Thanks to this, many talented people have gotten the chance to express their artistic vision through music and lyrics, which is what gives Vocaloid its ""personality"" and ""passion,"" something Polar could never achieve bc of all the corporate insanity going on. She will never have the range in genres and topics Miku could ever have, considering the lack of artistic freedom and individuality.","

            ","Something about Miku that makes her influence incredibly special is that pretty much anybody can use her voice to write music, so you can delve into a rabbit hole where there are hundreds of THOUSANDS of songs using her voice, combining the talents of so many musicians and visual artists. Miku is incredibly moldable and it's become almost expected that when she appears in a song, she will have an alternate design to accompany the song's style or themes.

It FEELS like Polar is almost trying to do that same thing, albeit unintentionally and incredibly watered down... Especially since many of Miku's different designs has spawned things like figurines. 

What I'm saying is, they really made a digital artist and took literally NONE of the advantages of her not being real to make a single one of her outfits or designs even REMOTELY visually interesting. Even the music videos don't take much advantage of the digital medium to go ham on making it look visually interesting and just?? Why??

Edit: OK editing onto this super quick now that i'm through the video, I just think its funny that so much of Polar's music is SPECIFICALLY about wanting to be real because they're digging themselves into this weird little hole where that's gonna become her ONLY notable personality trait","

Crypton (the company that made Miku) are not responsible for her rise to fame, its the thousands of small-time artists that loved miku's design/concept/voice enough to create songs with her, draw her, etc. Thesoul publishing doomed Polar from the start by making her follower count and views a core part of her identity as a virtual star

Imagine the mental health implications this will have on people. We’ll all be riddled with social anxiety because we have become accustomed to socialising through a screen, not actual human contact. We’re already fueling this kind of behaviour. Yes meeting people online in a virtual world is fun, but it should only be for fun, not for life.","

Miku is not intended to replicate that experience, and her success was accidental! Vocaloid technology was very niche at the time, and was literally just another synthesizer from Yamaha. That's still what they're marketed as - vocal synthesizers. That's a big part of what makes her image feel very genuine and iconic, because she is really just a voice for her community and not a person. Polar isn't attempting that - she's much closer to a vtuber or an idol.","

They get off on saying “the world is more connected this way”, yet people couldn’t be more far apart or isolated from one another. I’ll keep living in the real world, there will be lots more for me since everyone will be stuck in the metaverse.","

The individual person making the music is the one who gets the credit not Miku, because again, obviously, Miku isn't real. The Vocaloid concerts are mishmashes of a bunch of different creators' songs. It's a showcase of the community's talent along with the advances in hologram technology. Nearly all of the characterization of the Vocaloids comes from community engagement.

            ","Art is an intrinsically human trait, it speaks to our emotions, it doesn't have to be logical, it appeals to our urges, our fantasies.

Corporation with infinite resources will never be able to match a genuine human person when it comes to producing entertainment art such as a video game because corporations cannot compute essence. Corporations go for what they predict is going to produce the highest number of participants with the least number of complaints, as a result their formula for entertainment is always the same, stale, soulless. It's stripped bare of any essence that would make the content engaging on a personal level with the player, they have to compensate by using predatory means such as gambling mechanics and FMO tactics to keep the mentally gullible engaged with the product. An artist understands that different people enjoy different things and that you will never ever be able to create something that appeals to everyone, an artist picks their audience and creates a master work that appeals to that specific audience, people who are into that stuff will play the game because to them it is just good, not because they are coerced into it.  

Corporations aren't human, they are logical amalgamations of parasites always seeking ways to spread to the highest number of hosts and leech as much as possible before depleting their hosts. Corporations + art don't mix.","

Consider the premise that there are billions of dollars in backing in the AI industry behind the scenes. The benefits of that should be immediately apparent. Now, AI can do many things, and there is plenty of training data in terms of images, text and audio. What other training data could be useful?
Now, imagine a device that would track movement, facial expressions, voice and many others in the context of natural conversations with multiple people, without the people being aware this data would be collected. If there's a huge demand for this kind of training data for AI, it would make sense to try to make some profit from it.

polar is literally just a sponsored vtuber musician. miku expo has been a thing for over a DECADE, and theyve been using holograms for THAT. no new ground has been broken. polar literally has done nothing new here and idk how anyone is unaware that that kind of thing is old news. god, the hatsune miku rhythm game characters ALSO had a hologram show. at least i think so, i remember seeing videos of the show. and honestly ? they look better than polar. honestly mikus shows look better than polar generally, they just have a more pleasing style. polar looks like a mobile game.","

I wholeheartedly agree with this video, metaverse is something that is definitely intresting but the way facebook launched it as well as the security issues coupled with the testimonies of former FB employees to the US government makes me feel that Metaverse will suffer from severe security issues.

Also meteverse isn't something revolutionary and isn't going our lives as we have programs like VR chat which are already good and don't have security issues as far I know.

            ","It's true that Facebook's metaverse isn't going to work out the way they want to. I see more people in games like VRChat and ChilloutVR using the provided desktop mode or using a VR headset. Those games have soul that is created by the communities that thrive and create within them. I think Facebook is going about this incorrectly with a sterile and safe version of those social VR games and expecting soul and whatnot to exist inherently rather than working to foster a community of creatives who would be able to apply their talent to give the game soul. However, while a ""Marcus"" in vrchat is definitely something allowed, a ""Marcus"" in Zuckerberg's wild ride would be banned pretty quickly, leaving the game barren and stale. Or full of business people.","

On GOD they knew what they were ripping off. Miku's first live concert using the same ""hologram"" (used lightly because it's a projection and not a true hologram as we think of them) technology that she uses today was in mother fucking 2008, improved in 2011, and basically perfected in 2012 with better animations and models being added every year since. 14 god damn years SEGA, Sony and Crypton Future Media has been doing this with Hatsune Miku. She's toured in the United States three times (2014, 16, & 18), planned to again in 2020, was invited and on the artist list for Coachella 2020, and they are having the tenth anniversary of the biggest annual show, ""Magical Mirai"" this year.

This isn't even to mention that Miku's software was released to little expectations in 2007. She was made a cultural phenomenon by genuine interest and creativity from everyone who discovered their passions for music and art upon discovering her. She was literally created by the people who love her. Polar is so soulless and disgusting. They want the success of Miku without the actual creative heart, and while desperately pretending that they know nothing about her. It's genuinely infuriating and as a fan of Miku and VOCALOID in general since 2011, I'm livid.","

My boss digitally restored a black-owned church that got renovated, he was able to use VR scanning to create a virtual time capsule for our community. My job was to interview people and work to make VR accessible to everyone, since most VR at the start had a bad rep due to roller coaster simulators and family members destroying things bc they'd do it standing up on Christmas day. It can be very dangerous in the wrong hands bc essentially three of your senses are dulled.

            ","So let's recap: 
- The best way to understand metaverse is to experience it (by not experiencing reality, ya know)
- You can do almost anything you can imagine in the metaverse - get together with friends, work, learn, play, etc. (oh wait that reminds me of something - ahh, yes...reality)

This whole metaverse thing sounds like the new best drug around the block and to be honest, Facebook already is another such one. 
So Metaverse is a new form of escapism and addiction for those that don't want to face reality in its full brilliance because they just can't handle it.

            ","People who think this is newsworthy or even an issue of some kind clearly don't understand anything about technology, online gaming or metaverse.
An avatar can be anything, it doesn't have to be male or female or non binary person, it doesn't have to be identified by gender or species. That is the point of the metaverse, not to be real life but something else where you can be an energy being, or a rock if you want to. And voices can be altered as well, you can sound however you want. 

And to say that someone did something to you that you didn't want, is absolutely absurd. You can log off or even not look at the screen, and voila, nothing is happening.

All adults should be avare of the general toxicity that exists online, and that is nothing new.

People sitting behind a screen are  extremely toxic. So the metaverse will probably not be an exception.

And, to protect children from this new threat, I guess you should just be better parents and actually care about what your child is doing, instead of giving them a device so you can do your own thing and not be bothered. 

Everyone has a problem with the tech but not with their own neglect of the children in their home. 

If you don't set the rules and guidelines for your children, no tech company will do it for you.","

            ","How, exactly, can a  non existent, virtual avatar be raped?  Are the avatars programmed with  anatomically detailed sexual organs?  Are the avatars able to  remove the clothing from another avatar?  Why in heaven's name would something like that be programmed into the game in the first place?  If it is, then that is reprehensible, and I feel the creators of the game should be made to place restrictions on the game actions. 

Was there no way to move the avatar away from the others,  or to resist or strike back, due to the fact that these are avatars,  computer game pieces, and there is no actual physical restraint involved?  Couldn't you have ""pulled the plug"" on the game and put an end to any action?  You, the human being, always have the option of turning the machines off.  You are not handcuffed or locked into the gaming system against your will---you can escape it at any time, in a single instant.   

I am sorry to break it to you,  boys and girls,  that in any game where there are no rules, no regulations, and no restraints placed on players,  then the ugly side of human nature is certain to show up.  All the more so since in this game, the perpetrators are entirely unknown,  and can suffer no repercussions for their actions. This is the very reason that we have laws and religion in the real world.  

And I beg to differ,  of course human being are guinea pigs for corporations-----that is how businesses determine who their customers will be, and where they can find the largest, most lucrative, customer base.  And there is nothing unusual in businesses launching a program, a new product or any number of other things, and then acting on problems afterward.  

But seriously,  if you are getting to the point where you are mistaking a ""virtual"" computer gaming world for real life,  to the point were you are ""traumatized""  by something that happens to a picture on a computer screen, then you need to dump the electronics,  turn off the computer,  unplug and go outside into the real world where you can re-acquaint yourself with fresh air,  sunshine and real, living people.   If this young lady is having mental heath problems after playing a glorified video game, then I suggest she suffered from mental weakness and instability before she ever touched the equipment.  One is supposed to be able to distinguish between the real world and the fantasy one.    Unless, of course, she is looking to sue the designers for ""damages"".  Greed and cheating are also human nature.","

            ","This is only tangentially related, but my absolute favorite bad take is when Ubisoft was trying to push NFTs in Ghost Recon. There was a massive backlash, and when asked by the Australian financial website Finder about it, Ubisoft's VP at Strategic Innovations Labs said that ""it's not an easy concept to grasp"" and that ""gamers don't get what a digital secondary market can bring to them."" This is how out of touch these morons are. 

We've had ""digital secondary markets"" for two decades now. Gaia Online, Neopets, TF2, CS:GO, and every single goddamn MMO ever. We've learned more about market demand and inflation from these things than we have from school. We know exactly how this shit works, and we know what will happen when corporations try to control ""our"" digital ownership. Zuck has similar delusions. He thinks that his ""Metaverse"" is some innovative thing, but the idiot doesn't realize that these concepts have existed for years and been done better. Then again, considering he made a shitty knockoff of Myspace, I can't be surprised. He doesn't know how to come up with original ideas. 

He also vastly overestimates VR. It's still an expensive, niche hobby for most people and it's not going to have the rapid mass adoption he thinks it will. Gamers are going to look at his shit and point to VR Chat, and normies and businesses are just going to be confused. Why would anyone buy a VR headset to chat to friends or colleagues when they can just use regular Facebook, Zoom or one of the many other alternatives out there? Also I would just like to point out that Facebook is seen as a ""boomer"" thing now, most of Gen Z doesn't even bother with it. So poor ol' Mark sure as hell ain't getting any zoomers on board with this.","

            ","I also feel like they intentionally made her ethnically ambiguous, probably to appeal to the widest audience. Like, I can't pin down her accent, and she looks like she could be basically any ethnicity, especially with the mask covering half her face. Not to mention, as many here have pointed out, they tried to apply styles from K-pop groups. Oh, and ""Metaverse-born"" just rubs me the wrong damned way. Eughhhh lmao. It just sounds like a roundabout way of saying ""we are all one race, the human race"" and a sort of ""I'm from everywhere (so therefore everyone can relate to me)"" sentiment.

Similar to how Jarvis said he wouldn't have an issue if it was a real person wearing those clothes, of course it wouldn't be a problem if a real person looked ambiguous. But the point is, the company that created her chose all these traits very intentionally in an effort to manipulate people (mainly kids) into thinking she's both relatable and desirable and allllll that good stuff that'll make the company more money.

Not to mention the body shape they picked for her is ridiculous. I know people will try to excuse it, saying she's just a fictional character and doesn't have to be realistic, but the reason they created her was to have people receive her as if she's a real pop star. So, yes, it matters, even if we don't immediately notice the impact.

Basically, she's the ultimate parasocial relationship, even more unachievable than one with a real celebrity.","

            ","Working as I do in a software company I can totally see how the metaverse can end up so bad. Someone at the top of the company has a vague idea, someone a few steps down is tasked with making it. Someone under them has to write the user stories. Developers scratch their heads and say, well you wanted that, which is impossible, but we can do this.

No-one has a dream or a vision for this thing but everyone knows there's a lot of money in this project so they just keep working away.

I agree with this video that Zuck should have gone to established games developers and said, 'make Second Life' but better in these specific ways...', but Zuck, for a tech billionaire, seems to lack any imagination for this kind of thing.","
