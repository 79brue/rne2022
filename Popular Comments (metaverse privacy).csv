Many ads you see aren't even designed to be clicked on, but rather they exist just to be seen so they can send you a message.  If a person keeps seeing ads like ""Do you agree with Joe Biden's restrictions on guns?"" it sends them a message - even though the underlying premise is completely fabricated, and the ads are never clicked.  Come voting season many people have formed opinions about politicians informed purely on BS ads.  This was widely seen as being a major tactic of manipulation during the 2016 and 2020 US elections.  What's more, foreign hostile governments (such as Russia) are using these kinds of tools simply to sow discord within the US - they want people to be more and more extreme because that leads to societal instability.","

            ","I am embarrassed to say I used to work for one of these companies. Not my proudest moment, but I was also at a low point in my life and desperately needed a change. But I am also proud to say that one of the features I was helping implement was in response to European GDPR and California's CCPA: the right to opt out and be forgotten. They would whine about how expensive it is to implement such things; I helped reduce those costs.

Whatever John says here is spot on -- the groups he is talking about are called ""segments"" (related to market segmentation). These companies know EVERYTHING about you -- while most of the data is ""anonymised"", security and access control are extremely lax. A motivated, savvy employee could easily find out EVERYTHING about your online behavior. 

Here's my advice to protect yourself somewhat -- 
1. Always disable third-party cookies in your browser settings; Use Microsoft Edge or Firefox over Google Chrome.
2. Prefer Apple (iOS) over Google (Android) -- Google's entire business model is based around targeted ads.
3. Do not give permissions to your app to see your location other than when functionally necessary (e.g. when using maps)
4. Opt in to always clear cookies when you exit the browser. This is slightly inconvenient because you may need to sign into your e-mail every time -- but using a password manager (LastPass, 1Password, etc) makes things easier.

Bonus Point:
5. DO NOT SEND YOUR DNA SAMPLES TO 23&ME and other such companies. Your personal health info is guaranteed to be abused.","

Creating another reality where the whole population will double on number, meaning more possible customers"". That's literally what they are doing, they will try everything for you to buy that expensive bag to make your avatar seem fashionable.

1，分辨率，因为人眼的非常厉害的摄像机，同时眼镜有这么靠近眼睛，所以一块镜片的分辨率起码要超过 8k-16k 才可以勉强使用（同时刷新率要有 240fps 以上），而分辨率低的话人就容易出现晕眩感，而现在 8k 的电视机才开始量产，而且要把 8k 分辨率压缩到一块小小的镜片上面又是多难的技术啊。
2，传输的问题，上面说到需要使用 8k-16k 分辨率同时要保证搞刷新率，需要大量的数据需要传输到镜片上面，又或者大量的数据从电脑传输到眼镜上面，先不说无线传输的问题了，就算有线传输的话，现在民用的产品也没有办法传输这么大量的数据，同时要保证体积，体积还不能太大，因为要带在头上的。
我认为上面的问题，起码短时间内都解决不了，尤其是传输问题，8k的数据要保持240fps的刷新率，想想就觉得数据量太恐怖了。","

Of course this is just speculation, but the concept of that is kind of freaky. The idea on paper sounds cool, but in reality, when the technology finally reaches to where the ultimate use of the Metaverse is here, I think that it may have a strongly negative side affect to people's mental and emotional state. Today's social media already has this affect on a lot of people, but this could take that dial up to 11.

            ","One of my biggest issues, All of this stuff already exists. Meta is making it out that they are coming up with something new and revolutionary, However everything they have promised, pretty much already exists within the VR community. Except not controlled by some large Corporation. There's already games, tools and systems where you can meet people in user created worlds (through just an invite) with user created avatars (literally anything you want), where you can meet, hang out, date, play games, work, do art, almost anything. You can already have Hyper realistic Avatar stood next to some Anime looking Avatar and represent yourself how you choose to. 

So in short, as always, the corporations are trying to monopolize an already existing space and make it out that they are the ones coming up with the idea. Just pulling it into one space where they have absolute control to their own benefit. 
I can see how their funding can really push the VR experience further and especially with the tech create some amazing content, i cannot deny this. The quest 2 is already an incredibly cheap and accessible VR kit which competes with top of the range kits. But i think we've all learned many times what happens and is happening when corporations take control of something and the effect  ethically, morally and psychologically.","

Also, like a lot of other comments have brought up, I wouldn't want to live in a world where everything is perfect, and then come back to reality and have to face the imperfections, and as corny or cheesy as it sounds, the small imperfections in life are what make it beautiful, though yes, I understand that there are many of those who aren't fortunate enough to only have small imperfections in their lives, and have to face big ones, and this would be rlly helpful and useful for them. However, for me, I wouldn't want to get this. Like another comment has said, this is just VR chat with extra steps.","

You may then wire the valve to a simple switch circuit according to the manufacturers' datasheet. then screw in the showerhead making so that the reservoir of ""pulp"" is above the showerhead for best results( you may need a resistor for the circuit).

But, exactly as was stated, most cookie providers have resorted to dark patterns, making it incredibly difficult to see what cookies are enabled and how to opt out of them, which leads to another point: You are, by default, opted in for every single one them, forcing you to either swallow every cookie they want to shove down your throat, or, very tediously, click on every single one of them to opt out.
Recently, the EU has made changes to implement opt-in as the baseline, but even then you still have ""legitimate interests"" active by default, so again, you have to click, click, click your way into privacy, and some cookie providers don't even give the option to turn these off at all.","

            ","The “Metaverse” would definitely have to be built from a new experience. Microsoft has an advantage in that they have great intellectual property to include in their metaverse if they wanted to. Microsoft’s metaverse would resemble more of the Ready Player One metaverse than what Facebook could do, simply because you’d have familiar video game characters and environments that players can play alongside with! But the way video games have been built and are continuing being built, just doesn’t support a metaverse. It just doesn’t work that way. Microsoft would have to build from scratch for a platform and really plan out the experience because once you start, there’s no going back or redesigning from the ground up. So Facebook has the advantage there. Apple might actually be the underdog and black swan of this industry because they’ve been secretly working on their own VR headset and OS called RealityOS for YEARS! It should be announced later this year, but with Apple’s engineering and design team, that beast M1 chip, and Apple Arcade, Music, TV, and apps they already have what they have the advantage on both sides.","

Your videos are so informative and clear, which is refreshing and very much appreciated in the YouTuber financial space. God bless you and your family and I hope you have a great weekend! US stocks on Thursday rallied for a second day, with all three major indices ending up more than 1 percent as data showing a second consecutive quarterly contraction in the economy fueled investor speculation the Federal Reserve may not need to be as aggressive with interest rate hikes as some had feared. Investors really need to take heed to what Warren said about diversification. Most investors do it for the sake of just diversifying. Maybe one or even two per sector, as long as they are the top one or two in that sector. Also remember too the market goes up and goes down, not by its own but by investors. If a stock falls it's because some investors decided to sell. If a stock rises, its because more investors caught on to a buying opportunity or increased their position. Lately, discovered crypto investment trading and life feels more comfier. I advise everyone never to stop investing, never to stop improving, never to stop doing something new, to invest and trade you need to do it with an Advisory who has a great experience of how the market works. Taking this decision has been my best decision so far this year, i invested in bitcoin and day trade in which i have increased my trading portfolio to over $390,000 in profits with an initial $60,000 with the trading strategy and teachings from my advisor Mrs. MELISA PAMELA PEREZ I am able to scale through the crazy crypto market downtrend and saved my finances.

            ","This is gonna be a looooong read but probably important for some of the younger audience
I can see the potential of the metaverse in tomorrow's society. Especially the part about ""teleportation"", as it will provide an outlet for several groups of people to experience the world in a new way. Inability to travel? No need...you can do it online. But and this is a huge one...no amount of internet and virtual reality will replace the real world. It can't and it shouldn't. Life isn't perfect and it shouldn't be. Life should have ups and downs, highs and lows in order to experience it fully. People should go out, meet people, get loved, get betrayed. Because that is how they know they are alive. If you are stuck behind a screen or headset, stuck in a world that revolves around what pleases you, you will never have those experiences. Moreover, no amount of teleportation will take away from real travelling. I know that it can be problematic but those few moments where you pose with your friends/family in front of the Niagara Falls or Skogafoss (i think i butchered the name) or that memory of you getting caught in the rain and findin that wonderful restaurant by mistake...those cannot be replaced. 
And on another much more serious note...social media have made us distant from our friends and families. We spent hours upon hours on our phones instead of having a real conversation. I, myself, am guilty of this sometimes, especially now during covid and i communicate a lot more with friends that i would otherwise be meeting. Such a level of distance, where you can phase out in a virtual world, if you don't like being with your friends and family in the moment, will bring our society to an end. Creating this perfect life online will make us hate our real lives. Just imagine what happens at the moment to teenagers because of instagram. They are so unhappy with their lives that some of them fall into depression or, worse, commit suicide. All because of social media and the comparison between our lives and those of other's. Imagine what would happen when you realise that your real life sucks compared to your virtual one. You will want to spent more time there, while letting go of your real life. No exercise, malnourishment (if any nourishment). 
You can not quit social media. You will not cease to exist, but communication with people is not always easy and they make it simple. But do not get sucked into this madness and whatever you use, do it with caution and with a sense of measure. Invest in experiences, not virtual consumable stuff that will likely leave no trace of existence after you use them, leaving you empty. Play videogames with your friends online or by inviting them to your house. Start a conersation about their lives, their wants, needs and dreams. Travel if you can, fly a kite in the middle of the day just because if you so want to, watch a movie with your loved ones, read a book, make memories, live in the moment!","

I think it only managed to generate a visceral and superficial sense of alarm, but it didn't really define the problem and talk about possible solutions.
In my opinion, social networks are a tool; and we should understand them that way so that we talk about their potential benefit and risks in a balanced way. At this point, almost all of us are using these tools, to socialize, educate ourselves, and work. We can't just talk about this topic in a dichotomous way; we need a more critical discussion.
And I don't want to be misunderstood, of course, we need more and better regulation! But to find the best ways to regulate these tools we need a more critical, less superficial discussion.","

What is more interesting than the “metaverse” itself, is how this has suddenly become such a heavily marketed concept.  Clearly the PR people have done an effective job of getting this out to their targeted demographics.
 I personally worked on some interactive 3D internet VR projects, complete with avatars that people could create, and all sorts of elaborate backgrounds and scenarios, entire cities and virtual real estate in the late 1990s (ever hear of AlphaWorld?)..  A programming language for creating 3D interactive VR apps on the internet, VRML, started being developed in the early 00s.

Everyone thought  that it is going to be the next big thing, after all television were ubiquitous and cable networks can provide a existing infrastructure for internet. But that never happened.
Although we are using internet now but through PCs and smartphone. 
A new Technology will definitely find it's way to our life , platform/ medium can be different.","

            ","I first got into BTC back in 2016 and have been holding/buying sats at different price points since.  I've been through corrections before and will likely experience more over the future.  Volatility is simply the price one needs to pay if they want to play.  I don't have any Alts as I'm a bit of a BTC Maxi, but that said, if BTC hasn't died before, it surely won't do so now.  Stick in  there  - yes we are all feeling the pain, but over the long run this will just be a blip.  This is how I see past corrections when I felt that I got in at a high (back then I think it was less than $1000 and bouncing all over the place!).  Now when I look back, all I see is regret for not having the courage in buying more at those times. But if you believe BTC has value, then by all means, buy these dips if you can afford to.  For those who got in at 60 or 70K and feeling the crunch:  hang in there.  BTC is not a get rich quick scheme.  Wait it out and you will see:  you will come away stronger.  I buy and just trade long term more than ever, I have made over 9.5  BTC with 2.4btc in just 5weeks from day trading with Expert Mr. Kyle Miller Crypto in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish.

The physical world would likely become more boring and run down because we care more about the virtual one. And the biggest thing to me is how can you trust what you see and hear is real, it could so easily be manipulated because it already isn't real, see someone harassing someone well that could be deleted and no evidence would be left (though on the other side it may be easier to escape from that situation). Misinformation would be so much easier to create with the virtual world being already fake. Like to me it's just so scary one company would have the power to manipulate what you see and hear, and when this becomes your life well then that's just such a crazy thing to be able to abuse.","

These animated pieces remind me the 80s licensing craze or something of sort :) It is a great new avenue for fashion houses to bank easy money. It is not the future of fashion, it is just a new market for fashion to expand. Silly gimmicks bringing big buck, that's about it :)","

Let's say the government shifts and wants to go after certain ethnic / religious groups. Or people with the 'wrong' political views. 
With the currently available data on just about every citizen, any government could build a surveillance state with no chance of escape if they put their minds to it.
And I'm not even saying this is likely to happen in the near future. But none the less, this seems like far to big of a risk to ignore just so a small group of people can continue to make money of your private information.","

            ","I do find it interesting that he’s selling his version of the metaverse as if it’s a new thing - since as you said, even though virtual reality and the (albeit somewhat siloed) metaverse has been around for years thanks to platforms not just like Fortnite and Minecraft - but also like Second Life, AltspaceVR, ENGAGE, Virbela, VRChat, Somnium Space, Windows Mixed Reality Platform, Bigscreen and the former Oculus Spaces to name a few.

It’s only less known as it’s been not as widely adopted yet because of the costs associated with getting these apps running in multiple headsets concurrently at scale (be that over the cloud or between multiple headsets/PCs in the same room). Even then, as amazing as VR can be - it’s needing the motive to make use of it too - Education, Work, Conferencing, Church and meeting people without borders has all been made possible - but not everything has to be virtual.","

            ","Even though all these sounds like an episode of Black mirror, we have to understand that no amount of virtual reality can ever overpower the actual physical reality unless the VR has the power to change/modify the physical reality. Let's say for example if you are hungry, virtual food doesn't satisfy your hunger. You need real food (So does the entire ecosystem associated to facilitating it). Another good example would be a medical emergency. If somebody had a heart attack, no VR treatment can save the person if there is no physical treatment. So I wouldn't worry about actual jobs being taken away. We would still need gardeners, doctors, farmers, architects etc. and we would also need everything we have physically today. It will only exist as a social media platform with VR capability and people are not going to be using it 24x7...
