            ","Just so people understand: in the metaverse (which is just a glamorous name for VR), we move our bodies and heads. This data about why, when and how we move and how we react, can then be used by governments in the real world, through surveillance cameras for example, by pairing it with Artificial Intelligence, to predict how we will behave even before we have taken the decision to do something. It is absolutely terrifying.","

            ","As someone who works in VR (as a game animator), all I can say is that is a great analysis. I don't see VR becoming a widespread phenomenon, but rather a thing people like to play from time to time. Nobody in my team plays VR for fun every day and nobody I know does. It's too demanding. Though many people are getting into it, it's more of a curiosity than a real appeal. Some like to do their sport on it, some like to have fun with rhythm games. But nobody in their right mind would stay in for more than 2 hours at a time. VRchat users aren't in their right minds.

There's also a major problem for me (and for us as a company) : the Quest, as great a piece of tech as it is, is no more powerful than a flagship smartphone, leaving us to deal with problems and limitations dating back to the PS2. That's not a joke. It's impossible to make good looking games that don't look like polygon soup, the headset wouldn't handle that.","

            ","My dad told me a story about some real business venture he was trying to accomplish on Second Life years ago, probably around 2009/2010. I don't remember the specifics of what kind of business, I think it was that he and a team on Second Life had gotten the CEO of an energy company to agree to join a virtual meeting on the site, which was definitely less common then. They really had to persuade the CEO to give the virtual meeting a shot, the dude was definitely the type to keep things ""old school"". Anyway, he agreed. the day of the meeting arrives, everyone had their virtual look-alikes ready to go in the virtual conference room, the CEO was there, they were just waiting on one more guy from the pitch team to show up. When he finally showed up, rather than an avatar that looked like him in real life, it was a furry character. Something kind of like Silvester the Cat. This was for a legitimate business meeting that had nothing to do with furries lol. The CEO had already expressed discomfort with the virtual setting, but that guy showing up as a furry character was the last straw, and he decided to just leave, saying it was too much and he wasn't going to listen to their pitch at all. My dad asked the team member what the fuck he was thinking and the response was roughly ""I just needed to express myself"".","

In case people don't know, the WEF is funded by a large group of international companies. Last time I downloaded the list it was 851 that included more than 76 banks and financial companies including BMO, TD, RBC, Scotia is absent only because they are owned by others on the list, not counting some credit and payment companies like VISA, Mastercard and PayPal. Then there are the well known Apple, Google, Meta (AKA Facebook), Microsoft, Yahoo, Coca Cola, PepsiCo, Walmart Inc.. Of course not to be left out are Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Moderna. Some not really financial institutions but are institutions in their own right I guess, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Nasdaq, NYSE. Some surprising ones like The LEGO Brand Group, Heineken, the Heathrow Airport, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and IBM, Huawei Technologies. Honourable mention to Lockheed Martin, Mayo Clinic. The media cannot be left out... New York Times, TIME then an odd more concerning one if you are a teacher Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan. and some Energy companies like Shell, Suncor Energy.

The last 10 years at least, this obsession with giving our privacy away for free in terms of uploading your own heart rate to a company who does god knows what with it, to selling your soul to the social media companies and streaming companies that track your every move, to donating your DNA to pharmaceutical companies via ancestry.com. These people know us better than we know ourselves and they've been priming us to rely on these devices to live. People are addicted to the internet and attention that they would be willing to give up anything and everything to get it, including getting a micro chip to access it. Their whole life and identity is online.

Even instacart to ....prime us to shop in the metaverse and have it delivered by human for now...but drone later....tapping your apple watch.... on your wrist (apple pay)..to make a payments.

It's quite obvious if you can step back and take a look at all the ways they're getting you used to this way of life. Like it's just normal. A microchip will just be more convenient.

Locked down? Start an online business so you HAVE to be online.

Propaganda. ""Health"" books, biohacking, crypto. The more we rely on the internet, the more we give away our control.

I'd gladly give up the internet and even my phone as a whole if it means freedom and bodily autonomy. The next currency, if we want to fight this will be skills and trade and maybe silver and gold.

All I know is I ain't getting no fucking chips.","

They will be outside of the approved system and will have to fend for themselves in all day to day matters. Without access to any medical or social services many will die but for those who enjoy better health, they will live in enclaves outside of society and will be subject to harsh control by the authorities. The increasing shortages on all products including food will be the start. This has already begun. This agenda has been decades in the planning.","

            ","I must admit, i just learned about the WEF and their agenda this year back in January, i heard about them years ago but always thought ""the world economic forum"" was exactly how the name sounds, thought it was an online forum where people around the world talked about economics or something, but now having woken to what it all is, i kind of hate knowing about it, i almost wish i didn't know about it and was still sleeping to a degree lol. It's honestly a scary thing and i get anxiety from it. Here is my take on it. I believe that it's a new form of slavery, we'll go to work but we won't get paid, not really anyway i believe the government will give us an ""allowance"" we will own nothing because the elites/rich have inherited the earth. Everything we ""own"" will be rented to us from the allowance that we receive. They will implement the social credit system and digital currency/digital IDs to control us and keep us in line. I am a Canadian and look at how Trudeau responded to the freedom convoy, implementing martial law/emergencies act, and in doing so he froze peoples bank accounts, Trudeau and the vice prime minister Chrytia Freeland made some of the emergencies act powers permanent to be used at any time without having to implement it, one thing they made permanent was freezing peoples bank accounts, so if you do something the government doesn't like they can make some excuse how you're a threat or you did something illegal and can freeze your  bank account/money without having to get a court order. Also, look at Trudeau responded to the unvaccinated ""they hold unacceptable views"" and do we even tolerate them"" so my opinion and he made a crap ton of mandates for the vaccine, you need to be vaccinated to get on a plane, train, cruise ships etc,. He also made it so you cannot get EI (employment insurance) if you get laid off from work if you're not vaccinated. So i foresee this being apart of the WEFs agenda, and with countries going digital ID/digital currency if you don't get vaccinated i foresee them cutting off the ""allowance"" and i see all countries the WEF has infiltrated will implement the social credit system so if you don;t get vaccinated for example then you'll get a bad social credit score, if you get a bad social credit score you'll be blacklisted from doing things like getting your passport, leaving the country etc. I also believe that they'll control the food too, Bill Gates is a member/contributer of the the WEF and over the last couple years he has been buying up farmland, you control the food you control the people, here in Canada the government is trying to enforce you to have to pay an absurd tax/fee if you live on farmland and you own animals, you need them licensed too and they want to charge you a monthly fee on every animal you own, so if you own 200 cattle, and 50 chickens they all have to be licensed and you have to pay a fee for each one, so even if you pay say $5 for every animal and own 200 cattle, and 50 chickens for example that'd be $1250 a month which who can afford that? so it's forcing you to be reliant on meats/foods from the store which the government will control. So that's my beliefs on what at least some of their plan is. So i believe they'll control the food, and your money and any time you don't comply they will take everything you need to stay alive away from you in order to force you to obey them","

Your videos are so informative and clear, which is refreshing and very much appreciated in the YouTuber financial space. God bless you and your family and I hope you have a great weekend! US stocks on Thursday rallied for a second day, with all three major indices ending up more than 1 percent as data showing a second consecutive quarterly contraction in the economy fueled investor speculation the Federal Reserve may not need to be as aggressive with interest rate hikes as some had feared. Investors really need to take heed to what Warren said about diversification. Most investors do it for the sake of just diversifying. Maybe one or even two per sector, as long as they are the top one or two in that sector. Also remember too the market goes up and goes down, not by its own but by investors. If a stock falls it's because some investors decided to sell. If a stock rises, its because more investors caught on to a buying opportunity or increased their position. Lately, discovered crypto investment trading and life feels more comfier. I advise everyone never to stop investing, never to stop improving, never to stop doing something new, to invest and trade you need to do it with an Advisory who has a great experience of how the market works. Taking this decision has been my best decision so far this year, i invested in bitcoin and day trade in which i have increased my trading portfolio to over $390,000 in profits with an initial $60,000 with the trading strategy and teachings from my advisor Mrs. MELISA PAMELA PEREZ I am able to scale through the crazy crypto market downtrend and saved my finances.

I think it only managed to generate a visceral and superficial sense of alarm, but it didn't really define the problem and talk about possible solutions.
In my opinion, social networks are a tool; and we should understand them that way so that we talk about their potential benefit and risks in a balanced way. At this point, almost all of us are using these tools, to socialize, educate ourselves, and work. We can't just talk about this topic in a dichotomous way; we need a more critical discussion.
And I don't want to be misunderstood, of course, we need more and better regulation! But to find the best ways to regulate these tools we need a more critical, less superficial discussion.","

- The best way to understand metaverse is to experience it (by not experiencing reality, ya know)
- You can do almost anything you can imagine in the metaverse - get together with friends, work, learn, play, etc. (oh wait that reminds me of something - ahh, yes...reality)

This whole metaverse thing sounds like the new best drug around the block and to be honest, Facebook already is another such one. 
So Metaverse is a new form of escapism and addiction for those that don't want to face reality in its full brilliance because they just can't handle it.

            ","There's nothing ""new"" about any of this.  Zuckerberg has seen this as the “perfect storm moment” to create a sort of interactive VR version of facebook (I could care less what the marketing folks have decided to label this as), utilizing decades old software and interface concepts, but with modern low cost interface tech and high speed networks that can support this type of mass interactive internet traffic.   What is more interesting than the “metaverse” itself, is how this has suddenly become such a heavily marketed concept.  Clearly the PR people have done an effective job of getting this out to their targeted demographics.
 I personally worked on some interactive 3D internet VR projects, complete with avatars that people could create, and all sorts of elaborate backgrounds and scenarios, entire cities and virtual real estate in the late 1990s (ever hear of AlphaWorld?)..

The only people left in that picture are people studying the development of science and technology, the rest of us will be dead. The WEF have started the systematic removal of any homosapian that isn't needed as more and more AI gets developed. An example being the syncronized raising of household bills. There will be very few people left, relatively, in 20 years as us sheep are no longer needed. When the super rich have a robot that can do every job, why are you needed?

I worry that just like the job market requiring you to have social media and use it, businesses looking to shove products and services down our throats..metaverse WILL be forced on us. I fear that the future generation will become social zombies and psychopaths and no one will have any bearings that if we don't do something now any effort in the future will become too little too late. We need to band together boycott social media. organize and work diligently to not only educate others but work as hard as mark is at reversing this catastrpohe. Great things have been done by groups of people coming together BEFORE the internet. We can do this!","

Both were conceptualized centuries ago (hell, the very first car in general was electric!). Both had early rudimentary implementations of the concept using technology that was FAR too primitive to really do it justice. Both ended up with tarnished reputations thanks to the aforementioned (i.e ""electric cars are slow and can't go very far"" and ""VR will make you blow chunks""). Both have recently seen a workable implementation of the concept finally come to life, thanks to technological advances that was actually spearheaded by the smartphone industry.","

Edit: This all started with the present individualist culture we have. ""Every man for himself"", dissuading strikes and revolutions shifting people's focus of a greater good for fear of personal loss. Then applying restrictions on our freedom and messing with currencies' value as they see fit to test the grounds on how far they can go before anyone fights back. Lastly, the choice of ignorance. People hear about these events and the WEF and choose to deem it untrue without research, even though they do it on open doors. We are too busy caring about Johnny Depp and Amber Head's trial and other mainstream media like that. Everything has been checking on their favor. It's scary how things are going.","

            ","I appreciate your view point on this. This is the first I've heard of the WEF. I feel a complete and utter defiance to having a tracker in my body.  Also, in seeing how government programs work in general I could see ""Disgruntlement"" becoming a medical issue.","

            ","So right at the end. Everyone is trying to enforce their vision of what kind of world they think we should be living in. This is causing tons of arguments, and the only solution is to connect with like minded people who can also accept that everyone is different. Freedom is chaos. You have to take the good with the bad. You might just have to accept that Bob hates black people, as long as he isn't harming anyone. You might be Bob and have to accept that Justine transitioned to a girl even though you know  he's just a boy playing dress-up....Woke culture isn't ALL culture. Racist culture isn't ALL culture. Being more masculine or feminine, more toxic or less toxic....on drugs or not on drugs....these are all personal choices we should be free to make, and be able to live with this freedom around like-minded people in peace. It all comes down to everyone dropping their ego, and learning that their thoughts and beliefs are not the ""right"" way, but instead they are simply ""A"" way.","

            ","This could happen in big cities maybe, especially outside the US. But in republican-dominated parts of the US (over half the states)....yea this isn't gonna happen and certainly not by 2030. I'd like to see the government try and enforce this on the truck-owning, gun-toting citizens of this country. At any rate, once Trump is re-elected in 2024 this whole 'plan' gets put on ice.","

            ","I completely agree with you Sorelle....What the gov't want to make normal & legal is the legitimate slavery for all of humanity!  *Smh...The world CANNOT prosper in any way from such horrific actions!  If this continues to further implement, as it is...I can almost be certain that we all as human beings will surely be somehow drastically punished. All we can do now is pray for us all... ","
