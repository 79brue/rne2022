            ","Eddy there is something extremely disturbing that I think everyone is missing about this. These VR headsets use cameras for inside-out tracking. They are currently working on object-recognition to help ""bring objects into the Metaverse"". What does that mean from a business standpoint? Well you've now got people with cameras strapped to their head, building out a comprehensive 3D map of their most intimate living space, complete with a catalogue of every object they own and its placement in that space. It's an even more robust form of consumer data to sell to the highest bidder. And with AR glasses, you can contextually embed advertisements for products within a person's own home. Glance at your pantry? It's getting a little sparse, so hologram versions of the objects you normally buy occupy the empty space with a big fat ""Order"" button on them. Scratch that. Perhaps you sign up for a Meta Amazon subscription and they just go ahead and charge your card for everything they think you want, because your headset or glasses noticed it was missing, and it gets delivered within a few hours via drone. No human interaction needed. No need to go outside and touch some grass. This is the future Meta is building. It unsettles me to my core.","

            ","The conceptual problem with a ""Metaverse,"" open-source or not, is the same thing that afflicts the idea of the 'free' market; given any closed-system game, there are necessarily limited resources. As such, sooner or later, disparity emerges. Ultimately, somebody gets to own. 

Facebook (which we should be honest about, so let's admit up front that it started out as a seedy 'rate these chicks' site) is cutting to the chase by trying to be the first one to plant its giant corporate flag on this new, untouched frontier. It's another intellectual property gold rush. But as a new medium, this one's even more dangerous to the consumer than usual, because it has the potential to substantively decrease what is already near stagnant productivity, and further, it will cause even more frivolous spending in a people who are already in financial debt to their superfluous technologies. More servers will hum away burning fossil fuels so that Facebook may grow fat beyond control selling imaginary adornments for silly avatars to wear as they sit on their imaginary (yet purchasable) couches, all as their users shirk even more of their IRL responsibilities from their IRL couch. Granted, these threats to productivity were also voiced with emerging media of the past, as noted in the video. But those were different media, with different circumstances; though the past may have its patterns, it is fallacious to assume that disparate events of the past necessarily have predictive value concerning the future: that's the Gambler's fallacy. Causality notwithstanding, of course, pedant. 

Do yourself and the rest of us a favor, and stay away from the ultra-marketed enticements of this new technology until it really does become open-source enough to be beyond investors' influence. Those of us old enough to remember computing before Microsoft and Google had dominated the platform by completely eliminating their competition should recognize the smell of rotten once ripe. The once-empowering tool has now become a pay-to-play, with the concession paid to us in the few unlikely collaborative efforts which have managed to survive the burn, like Wikipedia. With any luck, Zuck's new tech toy will turn out to be a Nintendo Virtual Boy, putting this poor excuse for a visionary in a position of having just received his first real-time eye-poke, and maybe we'll be able to push back complete dystopian dejection for at least another generation.

That's not selfishness to say it, kids. Nor is it hopeless cynicism; it is a sober awareness that we're over the hump mathematically now, and that bad times are coming. To state it as such is a clear assessment of ecology, and of economy. The standard of life that we were lucky enough to know will soon dissipate. Here we see a preemptive move to strategically acquire what will be our surrogate for a better world: they're already preparing to sell you a pre-packaged escape experience from your awful reality. At least we can still delay what's coming, though. Stop wasting. Be mindful; stay skeptical, and pay attention. And most of all, remember that everything you buy is your (real) vote.","

            ","Whilst the financial/moral aspect of NFTs and crypto is terrible, the thing that fascinates me (as an English teacher) most about this is the language that the community uses. Like as a basic rule the two functions of language are to communicate ideas, but also to convey identity. The crypto language such as ""NGMI"", ""paper hands"" and ""FUD"" is so insular, yet also exclusionary and entrenched in delusional belief that it's hard for anyone outside the crypto sphere to find the motivation to get involved with the community from the beginning. The slightest bit of skepticism isn't met by explanation, but by knee jerk rejection messages. And when one of the community members is scammed or just doubtful, the responses are shameful rather than supportive. The community would literally rather exclude its own members with insults than acknowledge that its own tribal view is short-sighted and stupid. I'd wager part of the reason that crypto enthusiasts are so disconnected is because of the language use alone, and that inability to attract and retain community members is also something that is majorly contributing to its downfall.","

            ","Just a comment on the bubble burst back in 2008: I was there, Gandalf. Specifically, back in 2006 I was working as a programmer in the bowels of a company that handled and automated some of the paperwork for subprime mortgage brokers (don't hate me too much - I desperately needed the paychecks to keep a roof over my head). And just looking at the data I was seeing every day, I could see that there was no possible way this could work long-term, because none of the loans were set up in a way that the borrower could ever pay down the principle. And about 4 months in, the largest of this company's clients collapsed, taking my job there with it.

A couple years later, when the failures started trickling up to Wall Street, the talking heads were on TV saying nobody knew how risky it all was. That was utter nonsense - if I, just some guy at a desk at a not-huge company connected to the industry could tell it was all going to blow up sooner or later, I'm quite sure that the key players knew.","

Seeing that much of what you're mentioning in the video has been included in one of your twitter threads that started in october of last year, I'm sure there are a bunch of things that have changed and developed since then. However, most of the ""corrections"" I've been seeing from upset commenters fail to provide any attempt to actually update and inform us on what you're incorrect about.

The technology for it doesn't exist, we're nowhere near close to developing the technology needed for a virtual reality world of this scale, and even if, there's nothing legally binding NFT sellers to actually live up to their promise and deliver the NFT of a Kallax ikea shelf you bought back in 2021 into your virtual reality two bedroom apartment.

There is no metaverse. When someone is talking about selling you something in or for the metaverse, they're saying they want you to spend several tens of thousands of dollars on an imaginary object.","

I remember watching a video on Bitcoin being solely used in a town in a Latinoamerica country. I remember watching a video explaining the stock market crash in 2008. And, of course, all the constant jokes of NFTs I've seen. And to find that all of them are related somehow to one another?? This is mind-blowing, and completely drives the point home that these schemes often take YEARS to come to fruition. If you look at it from an outsider perspective like I did though, you'd only see one piece of evidence that, without context, looks pretty harmless. That's kinda scary if you dwell on it.","

            ","One of my main issues with NFTs is that they are, in some way, a perfect representation of the worst aspects of our society. Most people buy these things as potential stores of value, NOT because they actually like the art for what it is. If I were able to buy a Caravaggio painting, sure, it'd be worth a lot of money, but it is BEAUTIFUL, and is a rich piece of history -- I'm much less likely to buy it just so I could turn around and sell it in a few months when the value goes up. Most of these NFTs are also absurdly unoriginal in both design and creation -- not only is the art nothing to be wowed by in terms of style and detail, but many of them are also procedurally-generated, in that they're just randomized combinations of features on the same base. They also don't come with a real physical form -- that vulnerability of a physical painting, for example, is part of what makes it valuable -- it's why it's important to store and care for old paintings such that they don't degrade. For most of these NFT people, it's not about the art -- they are simply vessels for resale value.","

The fact that this all connects back to 2008 and arguably earlier, is just fascinating to me and it just goes to show that this is just an amalgamation of the all the broken systems and broken people those systems created. I think that the period from 2001-2019 will be looked upon by historians similarly to Reconstruction after the Civil War, or moreso the events leading up to it.","

My family spent an extra $700 just to avoid Facebook.

edit: some people are saying that we made a dumb decision to spend more on the headset (if valuing privacy is dumb, then sure). I should also clarify that the Index and and Quest are not really even comparable in terms of quality and power. I have a very high-end gaming rig so I also kind of wanted to be able to take advantage of the Index's superior capabilities. Trust me the extra $700 was worth it","

I knew what crowds looked like...how they acted...the dynamics of socializing, etc. Then I got out of playing live for the next 10-12 years. Then in 2016 as an old geezer I sat in with a band for a series of fraternity and sorority parties. I could not believe what I saw - how much the behavior of young people had changed. In the ""old days"" people who'd turned out to watch a band and have a good time were SHARING an experience with other people who were THERE. However, In these ""modern"" times it wasn't like that at all. Almost every person on the dance floor was staring at their damn phone! Even people sitting at tables were ignoring others at the table, instead pecking away on their phones. It was shocking how much things had changed. It was not subtle at all.","

            ","I probably shouldn't have watched this video till the end. Don't get me wrong, it's great work. I can't imagine how much work went into the research alone. So thank you for putting this out. But these facts made me so irrationally angry that I'm basically typing this out in order to exercise my feelings and hopefully feel better. I'm fairly young. In 2008 I was in elementary school. If there is any world event that helped shape me and the world I grew up in, its this crash. While the instability of the early 10's seems cute compared to our current hell scape, after about the fifth grade I've never really known a world that felt stable. So when friends or family members talk about purchasing stocks or investing in crypto I feel a kind of like full body flinch come on. Anything with numbers makes my head spin (I barely understood half of the video till my ""oh like MLM's"" realization towards the middle) So I don't speak out of pocket. And I completely understand why people do this on an emotional level. Money is so hard to get why wouldn't you do what you can to earn a little extra on the side. But I don't understand living in the world we live in and not know in your fucking bones that a crash is always around the corner and it will take you down with it. If you like to gamble, and you have the money to drop at a casino go off I guess. But my big frustration with middle class crypto bros is they need to believe in a sure thing. Success, money, the life you want is just around the corner, WAGMI.  And I wish people would just accept that we don't get the luxury of a sure thing. You can't fix capitalism with more capitalism. Maybe then we could work on finding a balance between different and better. Idk. Sorry for the novel. But I guess I do feel a bit better.","

TVs and smartphones at least have the commonality of being 2D, but being in a 3D world which plays on entirely different senses and parts of your brain, with the potential of you spending hours and hours and hours in it, will definitely have some adverse psychological effects. Mobile devices and the internet already have questionable effects on our psyches but this would surely be worse like......dissociative disorder/schizophrenia levels of worse.

            ","I just now noticed the twitter thread at 1:31:47 is talking about reducing the cost of having kids by developing synthetic wombs. It's just so painfully on the nose for tech bros to try to solve society's problems by proposing technologies that would take decades to develop (if they're possible at all). Rather than, you know, working on the things that would more immediately and feasibly help new mothers. Making prenatal healthcare more affordable and accessible, making healthcare more accessible in general, addressing the disparity in quality between the healthcare white women and poc receive, etc.

Like, in my head I don't want to believe these people can be so dense. I don't want to believe this stereotype about tech bros is true. And then they go on twitter and rattle off shit like this. It's just unreal. Technofetishism is really the only word for it. These people would absolutely re-invent the wheel and not even blink. They earnestly believe that any problem can be solved by inventing the right doodad. Without 1: addressing the underlying systemic problems that got us here in the first place. And without 2: realizing that what they're proposing is either science fiction, or has already been invented.","

The idea of a company as large as LegNovel basically owning the entire internet and controlling everything is beyond dystopian. We basically already live in a cyberpunk nightmare. The last thing huge companies need is more control of the internet than they already have. The internet is one of the last (somewhat) free things left. That said, there's no way it's going to take off. It's too large of an idea, would require so much infrastructure and investment in multiple fields. Everyone would have to own a VR headset.

            ","It kind of hit me watching this that companies pushing NFTs are far more sinister. They may be somewhat 'harmless' at their face value, but I can imagine the advisor pushing this within the company not just saying ""let's do this and make some quick cash,"" but it's really about trying to synchronize involvement to invent a new standard. In the same sense that while people hated the first game season passes or microtransactions, all they have to do is endure that first wave of bad publicity, and hope everyone else is doing it enough so that the outrage is diluted among a new, forced market.","

Business meetings become illegal with physical contact, no more real concerts of any kind, no cinema's or theaters, no stand-up comedy, etc. It should make you wonder how much of a coincidence Metaverse really is... since CV will restrict the whole world to interact in real life and the Metaverse is the only thing available.

Since you quoted Buffet several times you should know that he also states that the vast majority of professional investors cannot beat the market over a large period of time.

            ","As an artist, when I was still job searching, I came across a lot of crypto bros hiring to create the next big series of NFTs. All freelance, of course. And it‚Äôs all described with an air of‚Ä¶ condescension? Like ‚Äúyou silly little artists, I am giving you the opportunity of a lifetime. My extensive knowledge of this confusing technology will allow you success you could never have achieved on your own‚Äù while also claiming that the whole project is for the benefit of the artists. They‚Äôre trying to make themselves out as philanthropists, while at the same time taking advantage of artists who make them hundreds of images for peanuts in return. 

The way you talk about how they view copyright is also very indicative of how they really feel about artists. Their projects couldn‚Äôt exist without artists, but the copyright for that work is so worthless that as long as you put in on the blockchain, the stupid little artists can‚Äôt do a thing about it. 

So now independent artists now feel obligated to either collaborate in these projects or try to make it in the crypto world on their own- a world that will never value their work and only see it as a vehicle for speculative wealth. It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating.","

So unless you live with your parents who will feed you till your 30s I doubt this is feasable. The second thing was about him consistently beating the market. Since you quoted Buffet several times you should know that he also states that the vast majority of professional investors cannot beat the market over a large period of time. So no, the vast majority of regular people will not achieve this. For this reason when you state in the end that you could earn more than the guy who can make considerably more savings than the average person and beats the stock market it is quite false.","

But in terms of the virtual world, almost everyone knows what the Matrix is, let alone other sci-fi stories in either something like Black Mirror or Love, Death Robots and all the older sci-fi literature too that keeps reminding us: don't fall for the promise of a virtual world. And with the memes of VRChat and how VR is still not that much more immersive than it was 10 years ago, none of us are taking this Metaverse very seriously, and rightly so.","

            ","This video really, really, really, really REALLY needs accurate, accessible, culturally-relevant, and comprehensive Japanese subtitles (or an equivalent video).

The English-language internet has progressed to the point of widespread discussion surrounding all of crypto and NFTs that this video hits all the points that plague the particular social problems found within this subset of the internet. However, over in Japan, there is a VERY large number of digital artists who are successfully being pulled into the space, with the whole NFT thing being functionally-reduced to ""I draw an image, then I mint an NFT of it so that people can't use it without asking me for permission first, and then I post it onto my Twitter or pixiv or whatever"". There's a decent number of Japanese speakers who know enough English to work their way through a document if they absolutely have to, but I've been watching that space almost exclusively for nearly twenty years and almost everybody there just sees this as a new tech thing that helps them see occasional residuals and the veneer of digitally-enforced copyright protection for their cute anime girl pictures.

Every time I've tried to bring up ""the whole thing stinks"" to them it's almost always met with ""well, we're all free to make our own decisions, and there's no harm in trying things out for ourselves"" simply because the grift over there is buried under so many dependency/obfuscation layers that on its face, to a non-technical audience who has difficulty parsing long English-language discussion, it's effectively opaquely defanged as ""why wouldn't I want to have ownership over my own digital artwork?"" because they're INCREDIBLY skittish about how their creations are used in social spaces.

The problems facing Japanese NFT users and crypto enthusiasts aren't exactly the same ones that we face here; over here the space is mostly full of scammers trying to get naive people to surrender their life savings so the perpetrators can get out of Dodge, while over there it's kind of more insidious to me: it's more quiet, more ""this is a new thing people do for peace of mind so they can get on with their day"" that enforces a level of buy-in that has the danger of becoming more inherently baked into the whole ecosystem over there. I've seen ""voice actor"" NFTs and one guy I used to know actually minted NFTs representing his newborn daughter and his other toddler. It's insane.","

            ","Funny recent anecdote that ties into one of the examples of NFTs that Dan used when discussing the initial hype wave, and underlines the fundamentally worthless nature of the ""product"", that I'm sure he would have included if it hadn't only just happened: the NFT Jack Dorsey minted of ""the first tweet"", that he'd sold at the time for ~$2.9 million, was listed for sale by the buyer for around $46 million just over a year later, in an auction on OpenSea that ran for a week. 

By the time the auction closed, there had been a whopping 7 offers, ranging from... ~$6 on the low end, and a staggering ~$277 on the high end.","

            ","This is pegged to be one of the most expensive, colossal failures that will ever happened to big tech.

Until they find an alternative to VR headsets, it's not going to be practical or affordable enough for the average person to stay active in this space for longer than a couple hours at a time. This is all assuming that they know how to setup and have the appropriate space to effectively use such a device (even the most affordable ones). How is Joe Schmo with a 400-500 sq ft bachelor apartment able to orient his space to effectively use VR? This is not to mention those who are unfortunate enough to experience motion sickness, vision issues, or general mobility issues. It doesn't matter how accessible they make the peripherals, until it's near indistinguishable from reality, it's not going to work without inducing some severe real world consequences.

Even if they do manage to get VR headsets cheap enough for the average citizen to afford, it's likely going to take several years if we recover from the global microchip shortage. Not to mention, there are still a decent percentage of jobs that cannot function with purely remote workers. How will those jobs translate to the Metaverse?

Maybe this is targeted towards the Upper Middleclass with a large focus on whales, similar to NFTs. Can't wait to be flexed on by Celebrities, Arabian Princes, and China Rich kids. Sounds like a Utopia to me.","

            ","As a programmer (who studied Literature before), I find it hilarious that some programmers think that because they've mastered programming, they can master anything else. Thing is, contrary to people's conception of programming being hard: programming syntax is actually orders of magnitude more simple, consistent, standardised, automagical, and non-context-dependent than any given natural language. Pretty much all of us use one or more natural languages many times a day, in various formats. Yet despite how comparatively simple programming languages is compared to natural languages, if you ever do any programming you will quickly become astonished at how many bugs can hide in even the smallest program, how many mistakes you can make despite trying your best, and how difficult it is to identify all the edge cases that can arise. What programming taught me most of all is humbleness about the limitations of our knowledge, and how specific and context dependent any knowledge we have, is. I hypothesise that what these bros are reacting to isn't what programming as a discipline teaches you, but how society perceives and reacts to programmers. Whenver the topic of being a programmer comes up in my everday life, people almost always react with something along the lines of ""Oh you must be so smart, I could never do that."" And I always tell them that they almost certainly could. Every day they're doing things that are far more complex and involved without thinking about it at all. For programmers to think ""Right, I've mastered this, so now I can master anything!"" isn't just the wrong end of the stick, it's the wrong end of the universe.","

            ","17:30 Something else to note re: crypto's environmental impact is that, on top of the wasted electricity, all those crypto rigs also require a lot of physical parts. Sounds obvious, yeah, but if anyone out there was wondering why there's been a worldwide shortage on things like NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, a lot of it is because those graphics cards are great for running crypto mining rigs. And even the ones that don't use the consumer-grade cards use tech that still runs on the exact same chips and base components those major companies use, meaning there's a resource bottleneck either way.

So several tons of computer parts are getting made, put into crypto rigs, pushed to breaking long before their best-by dates due to operating nonstop, then getting immediately replaced and dumped in landfills because we don't really have the infrastructure to efficiantly recycle electronic waste even under normal circumstances. Or, if you're unlucky, they're worked to near breaking and sold secondhand on ebay at an inflated price due to scarcity and scalping (often with the promise that it's brand new, never been used!) so they can break after a week in your home PC instead. As a 3D artist who needs a decent graphics card to do their job, yes, I am bitter, thank you for asking :)

And all this on top of the environmental impact of the literal mining for the silica & rare metals required by these computer parts, not to mention the fuel based pollution from running the mining facilities and transportation. And yes, just like Dan's example with the banks, none of this is anything new. Electronic manufacturing and waste has always been rough on the environment. But it's like comparing a leaky tugboat to the BP oil spill‚Äî neither are good, but one of them is still *objectively & significantly worse*.

Even better, the only reason the impact of literal mining isn't worse right now is because a lot of them shut down for the pandemic. And because the physical waste side of the argument is so underdiscussed, there's no pressure to even performantively switch to some sort of green alternative the way you can with electrical use :/","

            ","As a digital artist, I had multiple people suggest that I mint my art into NFTs and sell them. I decided against it, on moral grounds.
The technology doesn't seem like it adds anything to art to enhance the artwork. People generally seem confused about what purchasing them actually means. Worse still, there are way too many scam-like elements to the whole marketplace. If I'd wanted to, maybe I could have put in some effort and made a lot (or a little) money, but I would have felt dirty doing it.
I want my work to be that of a digital artist, not a con-artist.
I don't think NFTs have to be a bad thing, but when I look at how they're being used, it seems like a trivialization and vacuous commercialization of art, turning something that should have meaning, into a pointless token in a speculative market.
Art should uplift our spirits, get us to look at the world differently, or help us find joy in beauty. It should enhance our lives as human beings.
NFT markets have not enhanced art, they've merely debased it.

So unless you live with your parents who will feed you till your 30s I doubt this is feasable. The second thing was about him consistently beating the market. Since you quoted Buffet several times you should know that he also states that the vast majority of professional investors cannot beat the market over a large period of time. So no, the vast majority of regular people will not achieve this. For this reason when you state in the end that you could earn more than the guy who can make considerably more savings than the average person and beats the stock market it is quite false.","

I'm glad this video exists because it feels like somebody is there guiding me through the exact psychology of a person who would buy an NFT as well as quickly defusing any arguments that may pop up in the inner struggle of justifying buying one.

A key historical context (which would have needed its own 2-hour coverage so no criticism intended here): the repeal of Glass-Steagall under Clinton in the late 1990's, which had protected against just this sort of thing ever since the Great Depression. Its key feature: consumer banks forbidden to engage in investment banking or sale of securities of any kind. 

We had even had a preview of the kind of damage possible, during the Savings and Loan crisis in the 1980s. Same dynamic, triggered by deregulation of that sector by the Reagan Administration.

In one sentence he told me that NFTs will be worth a massive fortune decades from now and told me to strike while the iron was hot. This was on a page advertising for Toys R Us NFTs btw

When he told me that, I told him that he was trying to sell me on a future that he couldn't see... he replied with multiple responses insulting me, telling me to fuck off, telling me I was stupid, claiming he made $40,000 the previous month selling NFTs... and honestly for somebody who supposedly made such a big fortune in selling that you think he would've been feeling happier about it but, no, he was super angry and screaming.

None of it made any sense though. If NFTs will be worth a fortune ""decades from now"" then why was he selling them the previous month? Because he admitted the market was already oversaturated. Yeah. No joke.

Seeing this video gives me a new perspective as to why he was behaving so erratically, why it was so upsetting for him. Gives me a greater idea as to what he invested into, what he thinks he will sell... and why he needs to defend the most obvious scam in the world.","

A friend of mine jumped onto crypto after meeting helpful ""business coaches"". First he just went to zoom meetings and conventions, then came the weird tweets about having to take a risk to not be a loser and not giving up when success takes too long. Posts that already kinda made me sceptical of his judgements, knowing he already fell for an MLM once. Then his social media became basically and advertisement platform praising the ones who made it and advertising their ""business calls"". The final straw came when he sent me a long copy paste message full of emojis and an invitation to those calls in WhatsApp and after telling him not to spam me with invitations, he first ensured me that ""his associates"" are totally legit. I didn't even debate that and simply said that I am not interested in those types of venture. After 5 years of friendship he simply wished me a ""successful life"" and blocked me. Imagine blocking someone who was a friend because they aren't interested in your shill and just appreciate you as a friend and not a business partner.","

            ","The comment Dan makes at 23:25 is one that really hits the nail on the head. By and large, I think this sentiment applies broadly to most of the STEM majors I've engaged with in my studies/career (speaking as a mathematics major working in a CS-related field myself). Experts in very specific disciplines like quantum computing, rocket propulsion thermodynamics, or endocrinology really believe that they're on an intellectual playing field elevated above all others, and therefore feel justified in their knee-jerk and often reactionary ideological beliefs, as disciplines such as philosophy and sociology are beneath them. Unfortunately, these kinds of actors play a disproportionately significant role in determining what our society looks like and the direction we're all headed.","

- Did you find you were ""tapping out"" more frequently/for longer periods
- How much external contact did you actually have with people in your life
- How long before you actually wear your VR gear again?

The fact that the blockchain isn't designed so it can be changed later on is itself a flaw. They've designed it assuming that it was completely perfect and immune to fraud before actually verifying that it was, and then when it was demonstrated that it wasn't, responded with ""Well, that's just how the machine works. YOU should've been more careful, that was YOUR fault. Code is law."" and then pretended as though they weren't the ones who wrote that code and designed it with no effective way of correcting fraud.

Crypto is dependent on the absolute destruction of the convenience, ease-of-use, security and customer service elements present in modern financial institutions, and above all the eradication of accountability. Conventional banks and credit card companies can be greedy jerks in many ways, but they also absorb millions of dollars of fraud and theft losses every year in place of their customers, because that is the price of keeping customers. (There may also be laws forcing them to do that, I don't know.) Crypto's plan seems to be to remove all of that, so that the people it cares about - the scammers - can make more money.","

All of those questions and more were answered perfectly in this, and now I'll avoid them like the financial black hole they are.

Some of my colleagues from work got obsessed with NFTs, and it was fascinating and saddening to see them devolve into the stereotypical crypto-bros.  Your description of NFT holders was spot on, and they clearly had no experience with any type of investment: when I asked them about details regarding the NFTs they were talking about, they admitted they had no understanding about them or the ""economy"" of the crypto marketplace.  I shudder to think about where they will be financially as enthusiasm slowly putters out.","

            ","Man, it's just hilarious how easy is to identify NFT/crypto fanboys whenever the subject comes up in conversation over the internet. People who don't like NFTs is ""because they don't understand them"", ""new technologies are always received negatively"", ""you just don't see all the potential benefits"", and all that crap. It's always them who are the smart guys and everyone else is dumb, according to them, which is why I feel no pity for them for falling for such an obvious pyramid scheme.

I'm a digital artist. Amateur, but still get the occasional commission. I would never get into selling NFTs. I know the fanboys love to say how it's ""an opportunity for artists to finally get some money"" and you know what else would be? Robbing a bank or selling drugs.

            ","I can proudly say that my son who just turned 16, does NOT have any social media. He does video gaming but I'm super strict with it. The fact that my 16 year old tells me ""I don't even want it at this point."" makes me happy because he does see how it affects society and people in general. Behavioral development is a big deal in our house, and I take my parenting seriously. My kids are an investment, the most important kind, and I'm doing my best to prepare them for what is coming. Everyone thinks I'm an unfit mother because when covid happened and everything got shut down, I made the decision to withdraw my kids from public schooling, because I didn't like where things were going with the masks. He has asthma, and I'm not going to allow the government turn my kids into a science experiment. That was back in March 2020. I won't lie, it has been a struggle, and I'm not a ""pintrest"" mom. I've tried, but thats just not who I am. So I teach them real life lessons. I teach them about having a moral compass, treating one another with respect. I do my best to educate them with what I know that works. And if I don't know, I search it myself until I do know. Until we find a more suitable situation with their education, its street smarts over book smarts for now. I teach them through experience. I may be seen as an unfit mother due to my beliefs, but my kids are not out of control little assholes, my 16 yr old is still a virgin/never been arrested/doesn't do drugs/ has manners and knows how to hold a door open for people.... and I tell him that I am proud of him, but these are things he should be doing anyway. When you go above and beyond the call of duty, and you put in the extra energy into the work you do, THAT is when the reward comes. And its up to him to figure out what a reward means for him. We have not had an easy life, and currently we are living in a hotel due to how covid has affected our family. We got only one check, and NO unemployment... I feel very blessed. As weird as that sounds, I still feel blessed. And now, its up to me to try to turn things around for us. I can't give up, its not an option. And I only hope I am teaching my kids the same. Every day is do or die. I grew up in a very toxic household and we will just leave it at that. I will be damned to have come this far for us to raise the white flag now. I don't think parents should be scared to be parents. The toughest job of all is being a parent, and whether you voluntarily signed up or not doesn't really matter, because now you have to focus on the child. Its time our kids stop paying for shit they didn't cause. Part of that is by dealing with your own personal issues on your own time. Life is a juggling act, and you learn how to keep the balance as you go. Part of that balance is personal responsibility. Get help for yourself if you need it, and quit waiting for someone to save you. Be your own hero, because to our kids we already are one. As corny as this may sound, I try my best to parent myself the way I wanted to be parented growing up while also applying it to my own children. I know what social media does to a person, and in my opinion, its just as deadly as cigarettes. I want my children to know how to have a face to face conversation. I want them to feel confident in  looking into someone's eyes, and feeling secure with who they are at their cores. And honestly, I see my 16 yr becoming a lawyer and my 7r old becoming a politician lol My son loves to argue his point and my daughter loves to change the rules lol","

            ","I'm a furry who has bought/traded/sold adoptables for like a decade. For those who don't participate/know what that is, adoptables are visual designs wherein buying it gives you the """"copyright"""" to the character itself. It's like Mickey Mouse but created and owned by small artists; like, you can't draw a fully recognizable Mickey Mouse and call it Mickey Mouse and use that new Mickey Mouse on merchandise without getting in legal trouble with Disney, even if you 100% created the artwork, because the design itself--the collection of traits that you can look at and go ""ah, that's Mickey Mouse""--is intellectual property.

AKA the fandom's been producing, buying, and selling digital goods for decades because like Legal Eagle mentioned, there's already a system for digital scarcity in the form of intellectual property which includes fictional characters.¬†And while there's often nothing enforceable in a court of law for things like adoptables, the community is generally self-regulating (i.e. community backlash if you break the rules, which can be crippling if you're trying to make money from that community through things like art commissions or adoptable sales). It's also now extremely common for artists to have TOS you need to agree to when purchasing designs. Newer sites like Toyhouse (which is a character storage and trading hub) even have sections to include TOS with a listing that will stick with it when it gets transferred to a new owner--which is also recorded, so you can see who bought it from who so long as whoever owns it doesn't delete the listing (which will, again, result in backlash).¬†

NFTs are sometimes compared to adoptables when furries complain about them, as a kind of ""but you're doing this too except with ugly rainbow dogs"". There's a lot of comparisons to be made, including infamously common use of bases (aka cookie cutter art) and prices based more on hype than quality (popular artists can sell a design for hundreds or thousands of dollars, with the most expensive adoptable ever sold fetching about $16K). But at least with an adoptable there's a baked-in expectation that you're ACTUALLY getting intellectual rights to a visual design akin to an informal trademark, plus 95%+ of the time a TOS EXPLICITLY STATING that's what's happening.... Sometimes you can even cop some rights to the original artwork(s)... Unlike most NFTs :/","

            ","I don't consider renting passive income unless you have professional property management. Most people who rent don't count their time and effort needed just to make a tiny return on their massive investment. For example, you invest $599,000 to buy a second home and rent it out for $3000 a month. Let assume you are cash flow positive on the property and you make $1000 a month or $12,000 a year. What would your annualized return be? 2 percent on the entire amount. Now, you can argue that your return is much higher since you only put down $120,000 on the property. However, you are on the hook for the full $600k regardless of what the future FMV of the house is. Furthermore, people assume that their home will always appreciate in value however, this is a false assumption you can make. In the best case, you will gain some capital appreciation thanks to the central bank increasing the money supply, however, if inflation heats up, you can see your property actually start to lose money in real terms.  This is because there is an inverse relationship between housing and nominal interest rates. The central bank will attempt to slow down inflation with higher interest rates and curb lending. We haven't seen inflation in a big way but we can see all the massive stimulus money that the government is pumping turn into inflation while taxes will be hiked to pay for all the COVID spending, your best choice is to look into LIBERTONCORP  Its more profitable.","

            ","I don't consider renting passive income unless you have professional property management. Most people who rent don't count their time and effort needed just to make a tiny return on their massive investment. For example, you invest $599,000 to buy a second home and rent it out for $3000 a month. Let assume you are cash flow positive on the property and you make $1000 a month or $12,000 a year. What would your annualized return be? 2 percent on the entire amount. Now, you can argue that your return is much higher since you only put down $120,000 on the property. However, you are on the hook for the full $600k regardless of what the future FMV of the house is. Furthermore, people assume that their home will always appreciate in value however, this is a false assumption you can make. In the best case, you will gain some capital appreciation thanks to the central bank increasing the money supply, however, if inflation heats up, you can see your property actually start to lose money in real terms.  This is because there is an inverse relationship between housing and nominal interest rates. The central bank will attempt to slow down inflation with higher interest rates and curb lending. We haven't seen inflation in a big way but we can see all the massive stimulus money that the government is pumping turn into inflation while taxes will be hiked to pay for all the COVID spending, your best choice is to look into LIBERTONCORP  Its more profitable.","

I don't think he genuinely cares. I also feel like he, along with many other traditional entertainers, want to diminish the work of internet creatives since they've pretty much made their line of work obsolete. Notice how petty Bill Maher gets about what the LA Times had to say about internet content creation being one of the fastest growing small business types. That's a dangerous thing for people like him. People no longer have to be born into the lap of luxury to get into the entertainment business. Now they can do it from their own homes.

What if, and this is purely speculation, someone were to hack you're avatar and teleport you into a literal hell. They could make you feel endless horrible pain, so much that it would be difficult to take the suit off. Even if that doesn't happen, the whole unhealthy real life thing (Physical and emotional) is enough to make me feel hesitant towards the Metaverse. 

(Also the entire thing is owned by a lizard man who runs a corporation that messes with peoples personal information)

(Also also, it's pretty freaky to imagine how this could shape the future. With all the movies and media about dystopian futures where poor people scrape enough money to have a few minutes in the ""Simulation"" to feel happy. What if that happens to us? I always thought ""They'll never have the technology to do that, at least, not in my time"". But now, it's right upon us. It really scares me.)","

            ","So I am a computer programmer and all this blockchain nonsense is really just a solution in search of a problem most of the time.  The Alfa Romeo thing, for instance, is completely ridiculous.  If they really wanted to have a service record follow a car, they don't need the blockchain to do it.  It's much easier and much more maintainable to store that data on an AWS server somewhere and program the whole thing using conventional means.  You could even just put a website on the internet somewhere and remind Alfa Romero drivers to request that third party mechanics go to the website and export their maintenance reports if they don't want to have their car serviced at the dealership.  Doing such a relatively standard task on the blockchain just introduces unnecessary complexity that, as you mentioned, is probably intentional in order to lock you into the Alfa Romero ecosystem.  Even if that was their goal though, maintaining service records in a more conventional way would still be cheaper, easier, more efficient, more maintainable, and more environmentally friendly than doing it on the blockchain, which makes me think that this decision is mostly about capturing hype.

The thing people tend to like about the blockchain is it's decentralized and ""open"" nature.  It's near impossible to make changes to and anyone who knows how to can inspect it so this triggers weird emotional reactions that associate it with some sort of abstract idea of ""freedom"" and ""transparency"" in the communities the stan crypto.  But it has, from the beginning, been a resource intensive pyramid scheme searching for reasons to justify its existence.  The blockchain isn't necessarily inherently worthless.  If it were disentangled from the crypto bros there are niche situations where a well thought out blockchain solution may be an interesting idea, such as recording votes digitally in a publicly viewable, but unalterable way.  Such ideas come with a rash of their own problems, however, and so long as the blockchain remains integrally tied with financial speculation and the fraudsters that gravitate to it, I think it's a good rule of thumb to distrust anything with the name ""blockchain"" attached to it by default, and I have, thus far, seen no application for the technology that has served any other purpose than an attempt to justified the continued existence of that technology.","

            ","As a digital artist, I would like to say: thank you for dedicating a section of this video to discussing how the NFT community steals art en-masse. If you ask me, then NFT's are really just your run-of-the-mill art theft with extra steps. I would like to add that the crypto-bro's do this mainly through bots: these bots sweep the internet for art to steal, and then mint it into an NFT without the artist's consent. Please know that about the entire art community hates their guts as well.

I also want my fellow artists to know: yes, a bot taking and minting an NFT of your work legally counts as plagiarism. And no, you don't need a registered copyright on your work to either sue them or get your work taken down. Just put 'patent pending' in the description of the work itself: please go back and do so for your existing work, and make it a habit for new work. Watermarks also help prevent it. Under American law, 'patent pending' is what you do BEFORE you get either an official trademark or copyright. But because the IP law in your home country takes precedence if you don't live there (like me, an European girl), this is really more an assurance for if the case goes to court. These two little words show a judge that this crypto-bro consciously and willingly ignored you legally saying 'don't steal my art' by sending that bot after it. 'Patent pending' is also legally enough to point to when you demand that they take the work they stole from you down. Please do be sure to look into the intellectual property laws in your country, though: if they give you a 'bring it' type of reaction and you need to actually sue, then you want to know what you're in for.","

            ","This video is disheartening to watch, but just because of the content, but because my brother is really into crypto currency and NFTs.

I'm an artist (on and off again) and he was telling me he could make me a lot of money with NFTs. I have refused up to this point for reasons of principle. But holy crap, I am REALLY glad I dodged that bullet....

I wish I could share this vid with him, but even if he did watch it, I'm not sure it would do much to change his mind. (He didn't like the flat earth one very much...) 

Update: so I talked to my brother about his thoughts on crypto, and I am relieved to say that he is not as into crypto as I thought. 

He does dabble, but he basically sees it as a another form of the stock market. And when I shared my concerns that it was like a scheme, he was just like, ""it is, just like everything else though.""

I am still a little worried, but I am releived that he is not nearly as far gone as I feared.","

            ","As an artist making NFTs I experienced this first hand. After  joining a few communities I saw how other fellow artists would just flush any resemblance of principles down the toilet as soon as they sell their first artwork and completely sell out to the whole crypto NFT GM culture  as some kind of cult membership. Even worst are the artists that haven't sell anything and just stay there by the prospect of getting a piece of the cake one day while the top artist tell them that they just gotta keep trying and that anyone can make it. 
 It's really disheartening to see how  any type of genuine discussion is discredited with  ""FUD"" or ""it's too complex for the normies "" type of arguments. I get it, most of this people (including me) were fed up with the perks of being an artist and make meets end. It feels amazing when you suddenly get capitalized and validated by a bunch of people on twitter, it makes you want to get more of that rush, so you start complying with the taste and narrative of the  NFT collectors in order to keep them buying your art while we all lie to ourselves about how this is the future of art.  I've met so many talented people mostly from developing countries like myself and I don't blame them for wanting to get a fair pay for their art, but it's dangerous to just blindly fall for the sweet talking of crypto bros whos only interest is to get more people to legitimize the value of their profile picture.","

            ","I think the most offensive part of NFTs is that we've had the exact concept FOR YEARS. Team Fortress 2, Dota 2, CSGO all had tradable cosmetic items which hold real world value and can be exchanged (for the most part) freely on Steam. This however has UTILITY BAKED INTO IT because THE GAME ALWAYS CAME FIRST. Each of those games released without a thought of cosmetics, and then after awhile added them. They also don't use Blockchain tech, so big positive there too, and they're better regulated than any crypto or NFT lol. 
The problem with NFTs is they're trying to skip the YEARS of reputation building, game development, and genuine talent that resulted in the cosmetic systems that exist in Valve titles, which feel like the least predatory microtransaction system in gaming with how far the bar as fallen. Even saying all of this there's still massive problems with Valve's skin ecosystem and it still gets used for fraud and money laundering. 
Valve already has the best case scenario implementation of NFTs in gaming with those stated games in my opinion, and they still have issues with it. How would a massively unregulated infant market like NFTs do it better lol?","

""I know it's all BS, I know it's rigged and not ethical, but maybe if I invest a little into crypto, put $100 in and get $1000 and jump out before the bubble bursts, that'd be enough for me."" 

As always,  if it seems too good to be true, it is not true. No exceptions. 

Thanks for this video.","

It all echoes a kind of weird way in which the The Accursed Share contemplated by Georges Bataille has left the strictly upper-upper layers of society and have become accessible to nouveau riche and petite bourgeoisie in a kind of awful wasteful excess that energy and material is increasingly feeding into in a kind of hedonistic insanity. All very uncomfortable","

            ","Well this video isn't aimed at me.  For years I was a musician.  Except for our first two records we released our stuff on our own label.  There were no fat cat rights holders involved.  When I was younger and not touring I supplemented my income with photography.  With music we never enforced our copyrights because even if you put out your own records, most of your money comes from touring.  But I did have to enforce my copyrights against businesses who'd steal photos from my website and use them to market their own shit.

I don't want to argue with anybody so I'll not be responding to any replies.  Certainly, though, it's not wrong for an artist to make a living off his work.  I can understand frustration against major labels, big publishing houses, and movie studios who abuse copyright law to horde up money and make people miserable.  I can understand why people get pissed at drug companies that abuse patent law to keep drug prices high.  But a musician, author, or artist?

            ","I'm sure someone else has mentioned it already, but in case they didn't. The idea of taking an Item from one game to another is complete bullshit. That will never work for several reasons. The best example of this even working is the Steam store having some tradable items across their own Valve games. You know why? Because implementing an item into a game isn't as simple as just putting the model into the ""models"" folder... I'm talking from a perspective of a professional developer with 5 years of experience including the 3D graphics industry and the game industry (although only mobile... yes.. it way painful)

So the reasons:
a) Any game that would allow you to use your NFT item would have to have development and artist power put into it... This is already a big no-no... if 10 000 different stores sell NFT items, there's no way all the companies for all the games are going to implement all of them all the time just so you can have them maybe.

b) Steam store already does this as mentioned, on a very tiny scale but they do... and they don't use the block chain at all, you don't need it... everyone that claims otherwise either doesn't understand how this works or is actively trying to scam you. But even if companies decide to only pull this for their own products (which already devalues virtual item NFTs to below even steam market items in terms of pretty much everything) How long do you think they will support these items? Surely they wont drag them from a game from 2020 all the way to 2040... We see how eager they are killing entire games with the whole games as a service scheme, what makes you think they will spend any more money than they have to to support any of your bought Items... at best you'll see them floating in your inventory somewhere being completely unusable and unsellable because all the games that support it are going to get killed eitherway...

c) Even if you make the grant assumption that every company will magically communicate and share all their money in a single pool of assets that all of them can use... This already comes with a huge artistic problem... Imagine Buying a beautifully rendered hat NFT or something... How is that going to look in say a game like Roblox/Minecraft? What about shading in different games? What about the amount of vertices?.... all of this custom work has to be done by someone, and there's a good chance it might look like complete shit given the aesthetic of the game (similar to what Eddy showed already)

d) What about item classes? This surely couldn't even work for different classes... you can't buy an NFT gun and then put it into a fighting game... You can't buy an NFT sword and take it to a shooter... You can't even buy any sort of functional item and expect it to work in another game that doesn't already cover that mechanic... You're not gonna shoot a gun in a game that doesn't implement gun shooting, because no one is going to sink the time and money to implement a whole game mechanic just so maybe someone can maybe bring an NFT into their game that maybe does this... It's bogus....

And hey... given the entire history of the gaming industry... even if all of this way somehow possible... companies don't like to share :) This is the same reason we have 20 streaming services that mimic Netflix now, all with their own premium content that doesn't stream anywhere else, and that's also why Ubisoft NFTs are being pushed separately from everyone else...","

            ","Having been an impressionable teen in 2013 when Bitcoin and other cryptocoins exploded and who at the time was very active in the altcoin communities, it is absoulutely amazing how your description of NFT projects -  the vague promises of future concepts, the organized overt pump and dumps, sockpuppeting, new cringe projects popping up like mushrooms after rain, applies exactly the same for altcoins in 2013 as it does for NFTs in 2021. My disillusionment came when I exited crypto and for years got emails from exchanges about the de-listing of dozens and dozens of coins many of which at one time or another had been in the top 10 in coinmarketcap. 
The grift never stopped and it never changed. The only difference is that random poocoins were replaced with monkey pics and the scam is orders of magnitude bigger.","

Since the market is all predicated on fear of missing out and the idea that intrinsic value doesn't apply to the NFT market so that a thing in that market is worth whatever someone is willing to pay for it (just like any speculative market), NFTs don't seem to be going well.

            ","I'm here after seeing Meta's trippy new ad in a movie theater: the one where a museum painting comes to life and a tiger quotes Rod Serling.  Then four hip young art students enter the painting and dance with a bunch of dead-eyed stop-motion jungle animals.  The end tag actually says ""This will be fun.""  At first, I couldn't believe how much self-awareness they would have to lack to release such a creepy ad.  But this video makes me wonder if Meta's offputting brand rollout is just an epic troll to make sure the metaverse never threatens their market share.","

To my instincts, the ideas behind Web 3.0 did not even rise to the level of too-good-to-be-true. But, I had no idea how deep its tentacles has already embedded itself. The realization that this beast may have already grown to ""too big to fail"" status is terrifying as to its implications, even for non-participants. It is very alarming and it has left me shaken.","

Sure, the monkey took the shot, but he created the circumstances for it to happen, and then he started to lose income because the photos were used without license and the legal proceedings ran him dry.

Now I see that it's by making sure someone else is left holding the bag in the end. It's no wonder seemingly respectable artists (and others) seemed to become NFT evangelists overnight...

            ","The quote from the World Economic Forum ""You will own nothing and be happy"", and combine that with the idea of the Metaverse, where, if the worse comes, and you won't need a car, a physical job to go to, or anything really, just an internet connection, a place to be comfy in your home, and of course food and water, which who knows, in the future could be sent to you via a drone or something, kind of makes sense. Of course this is just speculation, but the concept of that is kind of freaky. The idea on paper sounds cool, but in reality, when the technology finally reaches to where the ultimate use of the Metaverse is here, I think that it may have a strongly negative side affect to people's mental and emotional state. Today's social media already has this affect on a lot of people, but this could take that dial up to 11. I think we need to be severely cautious about the Metaverse, despite how cool some of the positive concepts sound.","

            ","If you think about it, we‚Äôve already been sucked into the virtual lifestyle through the use of social media  I think the most dangerous part is the effect on our mental health. People need real human connection. Many of us including myself have been sucked into the trap of creating the best virtual representation of our lives on social media that it sometimes becomes more important than our real life. We are seeing people go on vacation just to take selfies and be on their phone the whole time to show people that they went somewhere cool, but not actually enjoying the moment in real life. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, take a few pictures for the memories, keep in touch with friends and family online, but don‚Äôt get sucked in or addicted. This goes for the Metaverse as well. If you want to know how to live your best life, ask yourself, ‚ÄúIf the Internet didn‚Äôt exist, what would I be doing right now?‚Äù And whatever you come up with is probably what you should be doing.","

            ","This whole ""Metaverse"" thing is having a negative impact on my enjoyment of VR and the VR gaming community. They've renamed their oculus quest series to ""Meta Quest"", and so many of the ""new"" apps on the Oculus store are just the same meeting app released 100 times. It feels like browsing the wii shop channel where everything sucks. 

The Oculus store used to be incredibly curated. Games that were designed to make use of the quests unique hardware, and not allowing just anyone to create a game like Steam (not that that's bad obviously), but it feels like it's been taken over by some exec who for some reason thinks that if they just release 11 VR meeting apps instead of 8 then it will suddenly become successful.

The Oculus quest is really cool because it's affordable, has some great games, it's completely wireless, but if they keep trending in this direction I'm just going to save up for a Valve Index, because whatever they do I know that at the end of the day they care about games, not trying to own the universe.","

            ","One of my biggest issues, All of this stuff already exists. Meta is making it out that they are coming up with something new and revolutionary, However everything they have promised, pretty much already exists within the VR community. Except not controlled by some large Corporation. There's already games, tools and systems where you can meet people in user created worlds (through just an invite) with user created avatars (literally anything you want), where you can meet, hang out, date, play games, work, do art, almost anything. You can already have Hyper realistic Avatar stood next to some Anime looking Avatar and represent yourself how you choose to. 

So in short, as always, the corporations are trying to monopolize an already existing space and make it out that they are the ones coming up with the idea. Just pulling it into one space where they have absolute control to their own benefit. 
I can see how their funding can really push the VR experience further and especially with the tech create some amazing content, i cannot deny this. The quest 2 is already an incredibly cheap and accessible VR kit which competes with top of the range kits. But i think we've all learned many times what happens and is happening when corporations take control of something and the effect  ethically, morally and psychologically.","

That being said, I just can't understand why NFTs even ever became a thing. I'd much rather support artists by commissioning them. That way I get a one-of-a-kind piece of art and most artists will make sure that the commissioner gets the high-res version of the picture and everyone else just gets access to a low-res version. Or supporting artists on Patreon, where I pay a monthly fee and have access to their art. I see much more value in that.

It allows them to feel superior, ""these kids just can't cut it like I could, I put myself through college and bought a house with the money I made as a newspaper boy."" It also negates them of any blame for the current situation. ""We didn't play any role in creating a world where wages have completely stagnated; where home ownership is rapidly becoming a thing of the past as corporations buy up entire neighborhoods to turn into single family rentals; where no one can afford healthcare because the job market is being taken over by gig jobs, as a consequence, removing the normal avenues for people to access health insurance; where accelerating climate change continues to paint a grimmer and grimmer future; where tons of people have lost friends and family to an opioid crisis that THEY created out of greed yet continue to ignore; where traditional, good industry jobs are becoming obsolete due to cheaper labor in poorer countries"" and on and on.

That was the start of my awareness of the effects of Bitcoin enthusiasts on the actual real economy and now we progressed from banks gambling and defrauding the general populace with imaginary money, to tech bros gambling and defrauding the general populace with decrypted, decentralized, imaginary money. 

It's insane to watch them move around the real economy like locusts, monetizing and commoditizing everything. 

It's sad and frustrating that we can't do any better as a species. And to top it off, the ones who've gone overboard are freaking smug and self-righteous about it.

            ","I had no idea NFT's had such systems already. I just remember hearing they were mostly used for money laundering and figured that's all it was. Excellent video! Definitely the most in-depth video I've seen on this topic. This seems like a bubble that is going to pop one day.

I kind of get that using NFT's to pay for stupid useless things like jpegs is just a financial flex. However, what if that guy with the stupid ugly pixelated avatar saw hundreds of other people using that exact avatar? It's not like he can file a copyright claim and I'd imagine he would have some serious buyer's remorse. ""You paid how much for that stupid pic? Well, now I have it too and I can use it. Suck on that!"" No one owns anything on the internet. Once it's out there, people can and will find a way to freely duplicate and distribute it. 

And now both crypto and NFT's are considered taxable income. XD  So they can't even hide behind it anymore. And you brought up good points. If I lose my debit card, I can get a replacement. It would be a pain but I could do it. If you lose your crypto code or whatever it is, it's just gone. Or what about when people die? Unless someone gets access to your codes and access to your account, what happens to that ""money""? Does it just sit there forever unused in the ether?

And I had a long discussion with my brother about crypto currency. We agreed since dealing with crypto is effectively the same as using stock market shares as money, there would have to be a system to regulate that. No one will accept a currency that can literally fluctuate in value from day to day, hour to hour, and even minute to minute. That's too volatile for business and likely the average person. Not to mention there are THOUSANDS of different coins, all with different values. Are these coins interchangeable? Usable in any way? And as stated before, crypto and NFT's are taxable income. The IRS will have regulations about it which involves the very government they thought they could hide from. 

I never understood why people think everything can just regulate itself. ""Deregulate education. Deregulate businesses. Deregulate this. Deregulate that. It'll work itself out somehow."" No, it really won't. The greedy will always rig the system and honest folk will always lose. The only thing that changes is who is what.","

My study group basically had to pick a company from our field and come up with a bunch of innovation ideas for them, and then pick one and make it into one that the company can actually start using. We had a ton of ideas but one was that the company would offer digital nature tours to tourists. Because of corona they had lost a lot of business since tourism basically halted, so we came up with this even though we didn't really like it. The owner said that this idea wouldn't fly because the tourists coming in are craving for the real experience of interacting with nature and seeing it with their own eyes - not through a screen. They want to be there physically. And it makes perfect sense, and thus we abandoned that particular idea.

The second is ""the system only performs intended/authorized actions"", and is the one most people are aware of via classic computer viruses. The last one is basically ""can you actually use and/or access the system"", and is the principle violated by DDoS and ransomware attacks.

Blockchain technologies only consider integrity. They are awful at availability and do not even seem to consider confidentiality as something desirable.

It‚Äôs one of the many reasons why I feel uneasy about NFT‚Äôs.

            ","Thank you for mentioning the art theft aspect. It feels like everyday, I see another tweet from one of the artists I follow about their work being stolen for sale on NFT websites. The websites themselves are useless for trying to get them taken down, even when it's obvious they've been stolen. The system disproportionately hits smaller artists with large followings, who may have very popular work that sells very well, but who still don't make the money necessary to take any of these companies to court. Even sending DMCA take down notices aren't an option, because doing so exposes your personal information to the one who stole your work. I've seen some have luck by asking google to remove the image from their servers, as many use google to host the images (which still doesn't prevent a sale, but at least removes their art from the site), but for every one they take down, five more can pop right back up. 

And art theft is ALREADY a huge issue in art communities. Did you know if you ask ""Do you sell this on a shirt?"" under any tweet on twitter, a bot will grab the image and put it on a shirt on one of thousands of print by demand websites? Or on Amazon, they sell collections of hundreds of stickers using stole fanart and market it as an official sticker bundle? Even Etsy has gone the way of Ebay, where every other search result will show multiple shops using the same stolen stock images for products their companies just replicate. 

NFTs are just more of the same for many online artists trying to make a living, except now supporters of the thieves will come up to them and accuse them of being at fault for not joining in the scam first.","

            ","First: I loved the term ""toxic positivity"". It is a term that I looked for all my life. I will appropriate it. Thanks. I felt that only me and Bruce Schneier felt and thought this way about cryptocurrency and NFTs. In fact you went way further. I wish to send this video to all my friends and relatives  and colleagues that invested in Bitcoin. Unfortunately is easy to brainwash everyone with 260 characters repeating the same nonsense in almost infinite ways, but deconstruct, analyze and criticize it takes time. People would prefer the 260 characters stuff. So you talk to people that think like you and people that embraced the cult of cryptocurrency won't listen. All that enhanced by YouTube's recommendation algorithm  perpetually locking people inside their filter bubble. You may reach people that are undecided yet, or indifferent. Lets hope.","

Also meteverse isn't something revolutionary and isn't going our lives as we have programs like VR chat which are already good and don't have security issues as far I know.

Because all crypt coins are essentially interconnected and traded freely with eachother with some fees from exchanges. This nightmare means that every scam, every pull, every little crap coin drags the value of the market with it. That is why bitcoin has a line must go up mentality, and why it will ultimately collapse under the weight of APES.","

            ","Well, I came here because Square Enix's president said something about blockchain tech and I wondered if I should be worried. 

I'm officially worried.

Also, great video, feels like a good old long documentary, been ages since I got to watch one this well made, with a script this beautifully written and even more excellently executed. It was witty, clever, funny, at the same time impactful and easy to understand.

I also like the underlying stance you've taken, I agree that trying to accountability-push to lines of code is just terribly immoral and unethical, and selling pipe dreams to desperate souls is exactly that.

Human problems need to be solved by humans with humans, shirking responsibility to stay in the illusion and victim blaming is just terrible. It's cult culture, victim shaming and abuse enabling, and I hope people realise that before it's too late.

Though, as much as this has given me cause to worry, this video and the responses to it and it's views have given me hope that this message is being heard, that this hope continues to grow and I would like to thank you for all the work you put into making this video for the betterment of humanity's social structure.

I'm sure someone somewhere owes you and your video their livelihood whether directly from watching this or indirectly from someone telling them what you have shared here.","

Mind you, I'm not saying we're going towards an ""Idiocracy"" type civilization, I'm saying we are already there. I wish I had a solution for this, but is one truly needed? Because what transpires from this and from the last couple of years of dystopian rehearsal, is that people loves to be controlled, so what we should do instead of trying to force them into critical thinking and freedom, is finding a way for us, us intended as people who value freedom, to escape the madness and avoid being chased by the law for not complying.","

As a layman who feels like they're going insane when they point out that this is clearly a scam, this is a godsend. My only critique is that you occassionally put important info/screenshots below your face. Putting this info in the bottom of my screen means it gets covered by your (incredibly well transcribed) captions, and for a hearing impaired person this can be really frustrating. I wouldn't consider myself hearing impaired (yet), but I use captions in order to better store and encode important inforrmation. Reading is undeniably a better way to do this. Having to pause your video, disable captions, read the screenshot, rewind, and then reenable captions is kind of extra. I love your content and just want to help it improve!

It's supposed to be low return but also low risk.  The concept that a ""blue chip"" investment would skyrocket makes no sense at all.

It feels like everything is being swallowed by a combination of the worst demons that exists in the human mind and the oppressing system that has been in place for hundreds of years. I cannot really put in words what i felt during watching the video. Mostly i was baffled how shitty the system really is and sometimes i was laughing about it.

But in the end the video leaves me with an existential dread and the desire to burn the whole fucking wood of rotten and pestilent trees to the ground.","

It IS the internet. Like, as it is, now. It‚Äôs a way of reinterpreting the internet as is into VR, just like how websites look different between PC and smartphones, but much more extreme
There is no top down control by any company or any authority other than the actual laws of your country, just like the internet
Roblox, VR chat, Horizon worlds, Second Life, these are not metaverses nor can they ever be. Even if a ‚Äúmetaverse‚Äù was open source, if it was its one separated platform or app like Roblox, it would still not be a metaverse, at least in how it is viewed by modern people genuinely trying to build it.

That right there tells you everything you need to know about how deeply these people think.

Sure, for a somewhat financially secure individual, spending $100 per month on a hobby isn't that bad. However, it isn't $100 per month. The reason being that after 12 months, you now have 12 hard drives. So...

What do you put them in?

You're not putting them in an ordinary desktop tower cabinet. These things have to go into a server rack. And every year or so, you're going to have to buy another machine for another 12 or so drives. Not to mention dealing with drive failures, cooling for your in-home server farm, etc. And remember: this is a thing that is constantly growing. Even if it grows at a steady rate, your costs are constantly going up.

Can you rent space on AWS or similar services? Sure, but that's not exactly cheap either. And since you're growing 85TB per year, you're going to have to pay more and more each year just to maintain this.

No, this is never going to be within the reach of even a decently well-off individual. It's something that only quite wealthy or corporate interests will participate in. This is not ""decentralization,"" but people like Vitalik are so focused on their idea being great that they can't see its limitations and failures.","

Not only that, but technology does keep improving, so it may not even be that long before we DO reach a point of replicating touch and smell and whathaveyou in a virtual world.

            ","I highly recommend the book The Mark and the Void by Paul Murray. It's the book that made me rethink how our economy works, and has a lot to do with what happened in 2008. It's about a man who tries to rob an investment bank. It takes place in Ireland around the same time as the collapse of 2008. This is when Ireland had its own thriving bubble economy (the ""Celtic Tiger""). It dives into the theory of the simulacrum and how it drives not just our economy, but how we perceive art and our relationships. When I first heard about NFTs, it's immediately what I thought of. The purpose isn't the art, the purpose isn't to actually own anything. The purpose is just to have a number that's bigger than everyone else's. 
There's a part in the book where the narrator wants to invest in an artist and buy her a studio space to display her art. She surprises him by not being happy with this. Her art isn't expensive. Her art isn't a means to make her rich. It's just something she makes and if someone has a desire to own it, they can buy it from her already. This can obviously sound pretentious and preachy, but for me the point wasn't to make it sound like artists making money is a bad thing. What stuck with me was that the narrator is incapable of separating the value of art, or just the piece itself, from the potential money it can make.","

I still have the master file for the digital presentation... in fact, I have the original pencil-on-paper SKETCH!  What if it's tokenized w/o my permission and sold but I have the original and can prove that I did not give permission for this?

Do I have to start tokenizing everything, all my artwork dating back to 1994?  
Do I have to mass-copyright everything now, at considerable expense?  I got thousands of pictures and pieces of fiction!  I'm still selling collections of my web comic (which I have to get back to).

I'm not the only one.  This is being discussed along forums and posts on Fur Affinity, Deviant Art, and other art gallery sites.

            ","I think you made a really good point about being in ‚Äúthe real world.‚Äù

 I admit ‚Äì I do practically live on the Internet and have been using YouTube specifically since I was about eight; I'm 22 now.

 I've had a lot of good experiences on the Internet. But before I went to a public high school, I was digitally homeschooled, and I was SO lonely and depressed. I cried constantly. Being online 24/7 didn't help. 

Even as someone who is a very introverted person with little to no friends (IRL and digital), I still LOVE looking forward to physically hanging out with my family and my friends when I can. 

Nothing can replace that feeling because we‚Äôre biologically MEANT to be socialized face-to-face. 

Being online 24/7 like how Meta WANTS us to be IS UNNATURAL to our very core of our humanity. Humans are social creatures. 

We thrive in communities, packs, groups, whatever. We need face-to-face physical contact. 

Stuff like 24/7 VR doesn't help society, it just makes us more confused about what things we value and our purpose. 

Humans have always needed a purpose to exist, and we still see that today. 

Most people would prefer to see doctors IRL rather than through a computer screen. 

Most people eventually want to meet their online friends and LDR relationships. 

People want other people and it's not going to change anytime soon because we've been like this since the Dawn of time.","

            ","The speculative nature of crypto alone was enough to make me hesitant to engage with NFT's. This video seals the deal for me. NFT's are a hype machine con without the physical object to cherish after the hype dies. By attempting to promise artists the illusion of financial success, NFT's actually make those same artists the officiators of the con itself. 

Pulling the wool over the eyes of the consumer by selling the financial value of art but not the art itself is a bad valuation strategy. A career built off of ephemerality is doomed to crumble.

Further proof in my mind that the digital space will always be nothing more than a hollow simulacrum of the physical world. We should really start pushing each other to get offline more, esp as the metaverse gains steam.","

That's what we have to do now, with social media and entertainment.  Change our relationship with it, even if that means we have to say goodbye to certain aspects of it.  Steel ourselves as we stare into the void of our very beings.  Even if it stares back.  Build our characters as uncomfortable as it may feel.

            ","This is gonna be a looooong read but probably important for some of the younger audience
I can see the potential of the metaverse in tomorrow's society. Especially the part about ""teleportation"", as it will provide an outlet for several groups of people to experience the world in a new way. Inability to travel? No need...you can do it online. But and this is a huge one...no amount of internet and virtual reality will replace the real world. It can't and it shouldn't. Life isn't perfect and it shouldn't be. Life should have ups and downs, highs and lows in order to experience it fully. People should go out, meet people, get loved, get betrayed. Because that is how they know they are alive. If you are stuck behind a screen or headset, stuck in a world that revolves around what pleases you, you will never have those experiences. Moreover, no amount of teleportation will take away from real travelling. I know that it can be problematic but those few moments where you pose with your friends/family in front of the Niagara Falls or Skogafoss (i think i butchered the name) or that memory of you getting caught in the rain and findin that wonderful restaurant by mistake...those cannot be replaced. 
And on another much more serious note...social media have made us distant from our friends and families. We spent hours upon hours on our phones instead of having a real conversation. I, myself, am guilty of this sometimes, especially now during covid and i communicate a lot more with friends that i would otherwise be meeting. Such a level of distance, where you can phase out in a virtual world, if you don't like being with your friends and family in the moment, will bring our society to an end. Creating this perfect life online will make us hate our real lives. Just imagine what happens at the moment to teenagers because of instagram. They are so unhappy with their lives that some of them fall into depression or, worse, commit suicide. All because of social media and the comparison between our lives and those of other's. Imagine what would happen when you realise that your real life sucks compared to your virtual one. You will want to spent more time there, while letting go of your real life. No exercise, malnourishment (if any nourishment). 
You can not quit social media. You will not cease to exist, but communication with people is not always easy and they make it simple. But do not get sucked into this madness and whatever you use, do it with caution and with a sense of measure. Invest in experiences, not virtual consumable stuff that will likely leave no trace of existence after you use them, leaving you empty. Play videogames with your friends online or by inviting them to your house. Start a conersation about their lives, their wants, needs and dreams. Travel if you can, fly a kite in the middle of the day just because if you so want to, watch a movie with your loved ones, read a book, make memories, live in the moment!","

And your NFT only has a real value if others also see value in it.
For example in games like minecraft, if you have an item no one else does (like a cape) there is actual value in that because its such a consistantly popular game and so many have fond memories of the game, that even if years pass the value wont go down it might even go up","

On the contrary, some of them proudly speak that it is speculation that relies on misleading information to deceive the next sucker, but that's ok because they make money.

I think it only managed to generate a visceral and superficial sense of alarm, but it didn't really define the problem and talk about possible solutions.
In my opinion, social networks are a tool; and we should understand them that way so that we talk about their potential benefit and risks in a balanced way. At this point, almost all of us are using these tools, to socialize, educate ourselves, and work. We can't just talk about this topic in a dichotomous way; we need a more critical discussion.
And I don't want to be misunderstood, of course, we need more and better regulation! But to find the best ways to regulate these tools we need a more critical, less superficial discussion.","

I'd also like to add a couple of fun facts about millennials: We are the first generation in American history to have a lower life expectancy than our parents. Additionally, more than 40% of us have chronic health conditions. Combine that with accelerating climate change and the rise of new authoritarian movements, and the likelihood that a majority of us might reach retirement age with sufficient health and enough money to retire and go on permanent vacation is fairly slim.

            ","So let's recap: 
- The best way to understand metaverse is to experience it (by not experiencing reality, ya know)
- You can do almost anything you can imagine in the metaverse - get together with friends, work, learn, play, etc. (oh wait that reminds me of something - ahh, yes...reality)

This whole metaverse thing sounds like the new best drug around the block and to be honest, Facebook already is another such one. 
So Metaverse is a new form of escapism and addiction for those that don't want to face reality in its full brilliance because they just can't handle it.

No reason to register them in an immutable ledger if they don't legally bind the minter. If you need to trust the minter in the first place, you might as well trust its centralized server. Furthermore, the NFT is usually just an hyperlink which points to the central server anyway.

            ","If I wanted to set up a ""proof of ownership"" system for things like artworks, a much better approach than a blockchain would be to digitally sign the artwork with GPG keys from both the original artist and the buyer, allowing them to prove ownership without needing a complicated, power-draining and prone to scam blockchain. Artists could post their public keys on their websites or channels, so anyone could independently verify the ownership of the work without needing access to their private key. Of course this does still have problems, namely that if anyone's GPG key leaks then the document is no longer provably owned, but many of these issues exist with NFTs already. Crypto itself (cryptography, not cryptocurrency) has already solved this problem, in a way which works quite well, without the need for big scams. We already have large, public databases of GPG keys, so there's no need to worry about things like the artists website going down and no longer being able to prove ownership by public key. No minting fees, no other BS, just simple proof of ownership.","

What is more interesting than the ‚Äúmetaverse‚Äù itself, is how this has suddenly become such a heavily marketed concept.  Clearly the PR people have done an effective job of getting this out to their targeted demographics.
 I personally worked on some interactive 3D internet VR projects, complete with avatars that people could create, and all sorts of elaborate backgrounds and scenarios, entire cities and virtual real estate in the late 1990s (ever hear of AlphaWorld?)..  A programming language for creating 3D interactive VR apps on the internet, VRML, started being developed in the early 00s.

            ","I'll be honest, the only reason why cryptocurrency in the Philippines became highly sought after is because of the perfect timing of a pandemic where people were out of jobs and in need of money. They were promised 3000 PHP (About 60 USD) in relief funds per person, they were only given 1/3 of the promised relief funds. The people couldn't wait any longer to get more funds, so they turned to Pay-to-earn games like Axie Infinity to at least keep everyone alive. What's also funny is that the Philippine government also sought to tax Axie Infinity players because they've actually spent the pandemic relief money of military expenses and they're trying to find ways to pay off their debt to the world bank. It's sad it had to come to this.
I also do have to add that at one point, my brother had been playing on two teams and he had been playing days on end and cannot leave playing, can't spend anymore time with his son, just to afford his son's education and food to their table.

            ","I remember in 1999, a junior in high school, I wanted to create a website for my extended family to network on and plan events and be able to know more about each other‚Äôs lives beyond thanksgiving and Christmas. No one was interested. 

In 2003 I was one of the final beta testers accepted to SecondLife and I discovered ‚Äúwow holy crap community on the internet is way better this way! Watch out for that flying dildo though!‚Äù And when I talked to people about it all I would hear about was that they were now getting on Facebook and what I was doing sounded weird. So I learned to stop talking about it. 

8 years I to a secondlife presence and I learned that these communities are only as good as the people in them. I loved making stuff, I loved seeing what other people made but without the wonderful people there experiencing it the whole experience became totally empty.

As more people moved on the world of secondlife went from being a big place with a lot of people I was aware of to being an unfathomable place full of strangers. So I left. 

I didn‚Äôt know, at the time, that I was riding some of the initial metaverse waves. I hadn‚Äôt read snowcrash (and I still haven‚Äôt finished it because it is very dated and I get the concept anyway) so I was just playing.

Now I‚Äôm watching Zuckerberg finally start trying to usher the rest of my family into a metaverse. And they‚Äôll go because even though they don‚Äôt trust Facebook, people trust BRANDS. they know that Facebook got spanked a bit, Zuckerberg isn‚Äôt anonymous. They haven‚Äôt stopped using Facebook  , they‚Äôve just been a little disillusioned. I went through these same phases and now I get to watch them go through these phases as well. 

But what scares me is that I know how I poured my entire life into SecondLife. How real it felt. And how much of my real life I gave up looking for something that was already in front of me. And if the world jumps into Zuckerberg metaverse the way they jumped into his social network we are in for some very scary times ahead.","

            ","The ""code is law"" analogy is, as you say, obviously absurd, but I understand why someone might come to that conclusion if they didn't think about it that much.

In my first job as a developer, I would often notice analogies between bugs in code and loopholes in law, and the problems that arise with modifying either. If a law is written badly or interacts unexpectedly with other laws, there are ways that it can be circumvented or have unintended consequences. If code is written badly, certain values can be unnoticed ""edge cases"" that go unaccounted for and can break or pollute your program or data. Preexisting code can complicate and hamper what kinds of new code you can add. Preexisting laws can make it very difficult to create new ones to reflect new or changing needs of society. This is stuff you've heard all your life about law and policy. It's an easy thing to notice, and it makes you feel smart.

The problem is, while code may be analogous to the concept of written law, it completely ignores the fact that the implementation and usage and interpretation of law, and how actions and events fit within that law, is not the same as a computer carrying out your commands faithfully and predictably, consequences contained inside the program. People are not bytes, police and judges are not transistors, and outcomes of checks are not simply true or false. Laws aren't a whole-cloth, self-contained implementation of society.","

            ","Interesting consideration, have to consider digital land probably won't function like physical land obviously  but I see application. The issue right now is no one can foresee where this space is heading. Metaverse is an obvious choice in purchasing land as it's backed by FB but when I bought my VR headset a lot of people didn't want to have any association with FB like having to create an account to access their VR profile. I think if fears of future pandemics persist people will be more willing to stay home and interact on VR for shopping and social events, not to mention viewing events in other countries without the costs of flying, etc. There's a lot of potential and opportunity to integrate with cryptocurrency when you deal with the right source like Alphaearnersorg but there's probably a long way until a platform exists for it","

            ","""Innovation so mundane.."" I'm a programmer and I've always called this ""Rube Goldberg Design"". The programmer was so busy thinking about whether they could, they never stopped to evaluate whether they should. It always manifests in a complex system that can't be easily reconciled with normal human behavior. For example, absurd restrictions on passwords coupled with enforced regular password changes. Systems like that are less secure because users are forced to use difficult-to-remember passwords which radically increases the risk of passwords being stored unsafely.

Cryptocurrency, on the balance, runs afoul of this. Bitcoin is vulnerable to loss via user error. NFTs offer few perks above traditional IP law, but are a magnitude more difficult to understand and use. Blockchains create artificial security through artificial consumption of real, genuinely scarce, resources. The price of decentralization is bloat, and the benefits are questionable at best.","

            ","I guess this oversimplification happens not only for speedy development of the first version but also to make it light weight so any toaster computer can run it, allowing more people to join. They did the same with Sims 4 vs Sims 3 because they wanted to allow people with cheap computers to play and, possibly, mobile devices.

Their focus on profit is very clear because the lack of care about the quality of the product shows they just want people to have a place to be and spend money on, even if at a suboptimal satisfaction level, since they'll surely monetize their current Facebook audience with ads all over the place and there's tons of people who'll buy into the idea.

Now, if they'll make it look decent, ever, we don't know. If it becomes profitable and ""it ain't broken"" they won't ""fix it"". If it's a massive fail they might just abort the entire project. They'll only make something appealing if competition comes around with better offerings. Second Life is around for two decades or so and their graphics didn't seem to evolve much, neither its economy or popularity.

Bringing the burden of space-time to a virtual context while we can just achieve things much more efficiently in other ways is a bit of a task in the sense it's difficult to make it appealing enough to justify the effort. If, on the other hand, they can deliver comfortable hardware to allow a more immersive experience it can be quite interesting since people would be able to ""check in"" different realities where they can be in beautiful places interacting with entertaining AIs or people that share similar perspectives etc. Future integration with our neurological system might make the experience an entire different level of existence where we can see more than our ""regular million colors"", feel textures, enjoy smells and flavors unimaginable in the real world, and all without requiring massive amounts of resources to provide us with all that food, nice housing, beautiful landscapes etc.

Now, will that mean ""life"" in the physical world becomes too boring, sad and unappealing? I think so. Some lucky people might find ways to work in those virtual worlds, but in the end of the day we are still a long way from having 100% of physical work done by machines or a handful of people who might actually enjoy it. How do you force people to be productive and how do you keep the physical world from being a dreadful boring / dirty / ugly / dystopian place where people just do the bare minimum and probably rent micro apartments just so they can sit on a chair / bed / whatever else while possibly being hooked up to a machine that filters your blood, feeds you and deals with your body while you disconnect from this reality to live in the virtual one?

Only time will tell if technology will advance in all segments in sync to make a ""happy"" future possible. If one part is ahead of the other we'll surely have to deal with growing pains.","

            ","Okay so weird rant time:
In Korea, we have something called a mandatory service in which from any age between 18-30, we have to serve at least 19 months of military, police, security etc services to give back and do part for our country.

As a kid, because of this, I really wanted to grow up and become a military man. I wanted to do that full time, because it's what we grew around and up with! But as I grew up and moved countries, I suddenly wanted to become a fireman! Why? Because kids TV shows like fireman Sam! 

Eventually I found my talent in digital art, fine art and a hobby of gaming. The thing is, I'd LOVE to make them my career! But I don't have the millions this man does to even begin that. I don't have the luck, surroundings, lifestyle to fit it. 

Would I like to be an online influencer? SURE! Vtubers have got me through quarantine these past two years, as well as certain eSports and other streamers. But that isn't my only goal in life, or a dream in life. I adore art, I adore history of artists! I know my self worth to a certain degree.

Also! I hate that online influencer has become an insult via mainstream 50 year old comedians with failing views even though they have entire teams and millions to fall back on via the company which broadcasts them. The talent gap is unreal, but just not in their favour. I think we have hit a generation where celebrities are slowly becoming less of godhood figures and more... Real.. but it's a transition which has happened so fast over just 10 years that it's not something ""mainstream celebrities"" can comprehend. Like this man? To us his job will just be a """"comedian"""", but online influencers around us are often more than just entertainers. Nurses and doctors often make their content, plastic surgeons make education and morale boosters, Nilered got me my A's in all 3 science categories! They're real people who have other visible talents and aren't honed to one thing unlike actors, comedians etc most often are.","

            ","The main argument for patents is incentive. If some guy spent 5 years and 1,000,000$ to develop a valuable piece of technology that could be copied easily where's his incentive if some giant company copies his work and produces it for cheaper than he could have since he spent all his extra resources developing the technology. He can't sell it to anyone since they can just copy it without repercussions. After a while nobody will bother putting forth the effort into developing new technology. Or at least it seems that way in practice.

I do agree that copyright is messed up. It wasn't meant to last forever like Disney has made it become.

You present abuses of the current system but that doesn't mean that patents and copyright aren't something good under the right conditions. Any tool can be used for good or evil.","

            ","Not sure if there's a point in living a comment in this ocean of over 50k of them, but I really liked the final conclusion and I feel we can go deeper. This complete financialization of our lives is not just in the wet dreams of tech bros. It's a direct consequence of the very notion of individual that has been fostered by neoliberalism for decades. Our world is a world of objects and owners. We can no longer conceive of anything outside the grammar of property.
We can't conceive of defending nature for itself, we must defend nature because it's ""our world"". Even the notion of ""freedom"" as ""autonomy"" (aka ""ruling over yourself"" aka ""self-ownership"") implies that we are objects to be owned. Forever split into pilots and machines. Slaves and masters of ourselves. Matters of abuse, abortion, religion, are all about deciding when a new individual is minted, when my property (my body) is being invaded. We only interact with each other as tiny companies signing tiny contracts. We ""invest"" in relationships, in our health, in our education. Every action must have a ROI, every life decision should be made via risk-assessment diagrams and rational accounting of pros and cons.
Those tech bros think smart contracts will be the future because they are swimming deep in the same ideological pool we were all born into, which is one that says that a good and well-adjusted life will come from turning our psyche and inner monologue into a bunch of smart contracts. This is not a shift, it's merely an acceleration.
We must recover the knowledge that anthropology and sociology brings us, that ""a network of property owners negotiating self-interests"" is not the only way to understand ourselves and the world. That there were other ways to conceptualize subjects, and we can make up new ways still. The liberal notion of ""individual"" is not the only possible way to exist, it's only the latest. And maybe, just maybe, it's not the best one.","

Crypto is based on a laughably simplistic understanding of inflation. Money needs to grow with the economy. The economy is typically always growing so there always needs to be new money created in the market to keep up with the growth. Money creation typically outpaces growth, so the money supply then has to be decreased. This is monetary policy which requires the analysis of a multitude of economic indicators. This is just how capitalism works, and crypto has no way of matching the money supply with the needs of the economy. So, it would never work as a currency without addressing this issue.","

The physical world would likely become more boring and run down because we care more about the virtual one. And the biggest thing to me is how can you trust what you see and hear is real, it could so easily be manipulated because it already isn't real, see someone harassing someone well that could be deleted and no evidence would be left (though on the other side it may be easier to escape from that situation). Misinformation would be so much easier to create with the virtual world being already fake. Like to me it's just so scary one company would have the power to manipulate what you see and hear, and when this becomes your life well then that's just such a crazy thing to be able to abuse.","

It‚Äôs only less known as it‚Äôs been not as widely adopted yet because of the costs associated with getting these apps running in multiple headsets concurrently at scale (be that over the cloud or between multiple headsets/PCs in the same room). Even then, as amazing as VR can be - it‚Äôs needing the motive to make use of it too - Education, Work, Conferencing, Church and meeting people without borders has all been made possible - but not everything has to be virtual.","

Another good example would be a medical emergency. If somebody had a heart attack, no VR treatment can save the person if there is no physical treatment. So I wouldn't worry about actual jobs being taken away. We would still need gardeners, doctors, farmers, architects etc. and we would also need everything we have physically today.

I fear about what the future may bring when a capitalist society goes rampant with dystopian tactics of exploiting and manipulating the populace, but knowing people like you are out here doing investigative work to expose such practices gives me some hope. Words cannot do justice for how glad I am for your teams hard work on this. Seriously, you guys earned it.","

My Mom (who is a struggling artist and art teacher) asked me about NFT's. I told her while there is a lot of money to be made, it really is just a dumpster fire.


(Before anyone shits on my Mom, she actually creates some really nice pieces of contemporary art, with a splash of romanticism)","

            ","I strongly disagree with the way you've generalized the motivations for copyright and framed it as purely philosophical. Have you considered a corporation or anyone with more resources or clout simply pilfering wholesale a story from some upcoming creator and getting all the recognition for it? (Consider what Disney's pulled off with the Lion King, and that's with the existence of copyright. We shouldn't lower the barrier to entry for shit like that) And how is an artist going to keep a painstakingly developed canon straight with tons of altered copies and branches littering the same space? I can go on with creative examples, but what about technical ideas that can be recreated before you can get yourself of the ground? You've completely ignored the sensible uses of copyright, only presenting its abuses. Copyright needs massive simplification and reworking, sure, but being against it entirely is an awful position. We live in an age where information can travel to millions in an instant in certain hands, and far more wealth is generated than another other part of human history. This landscape creates the need for copyright law.

I think that copyright, at least for a specific work, should:
-continue to be allotted on creation 
-expire into public domain after 20 years
-strictly adhere to the principles of Fair Use
-allow for distribution of non-commercial copies as long as they are done by those with less reach/resources and are properly credited (honestly hard to define by law and it would be better if this was a culturally enforced thing, like how more indie game devs now are chill/knowledgeable about piracy and against DRM)

That applies to things like all those NES games that should have been preserved in public domain instead of held hostage by Nintendo. But then when it comes to designs, like Mario as a character, I think rights for that should persist longer, but I'm not sure about the conditions. 
There's lots of dialogue to have about this, just not writing of copyright entirely.","

Sure new users will be wowed by the Quest offerings, but don't expect to play AAA games in VR and get a good experience on the Quest. All Facebook is interested in is furthering their business model, which is collecting information on its users. They really don't care about giving you serious VR as long as they can get your information. Also, being a huge company with mega resources, they can market anything they make to sound really good.

1) Programmers are in general quite good at planning for contingencies - we have to be. This is part of why most programmers are vehemently opposed to NFTs - they‚Äôre so poorly made that it‚Äôs physically painful.
2) I don‚Äôt know where this weasely, ‚Äúthey might have a use‚Äù comes from. NFTs do not, will not, and cannot, have a use for one simple reason: we already have significantly better solutions for the same problem, and we‚Äôve had them for decades now (they‚Äôre rarely useful, but we do have them). The only innovations in NFTs are in scamming and making people excited for what is, at best, a money laundering machine.","

I'm not really a social VR guy, so I would hate to be forced to use a social VR service to enjoy a singleplayer game. As long as things keep ending up on Steam, I'll probably be fine with it.","

            ","I agree that walking away from social media is key to taking our lives back. I worry that just like the job market requiring you to have social media and use it, businesses looking to shove products and services down our throats..metaverse WILL be forced on us. I fear that the future generation will become social zombies and psychopaths and no one will have any bearings that if we don't do something now any effort in the future will become too little too late. We need to band together boycott social media. organize and work diligently to not only educate others but work as hard as mark is at reversing this catastrpohe. Great things have been done by groups of people coming together BEFORE the internet. We can do this!","
