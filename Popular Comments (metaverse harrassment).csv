When I was zoning out I would literally pull my phone out and my thumb would automatically scroll to where the Facebook app icon was in my phone.

Quality of life has been so much better.,"

What if, and this is purely speculation, someone were to hack you're avatar and teleport you into a literal hell. They could make you feel endless horrible pain, so much that it would be difficult to take the suit off. Even if that doesn't happen, the whole unhealthy real life thing (Physical and emotional) is enough to make me feel hesitant towards the Metaverse. 

(Also the entire thing is owned by a lizard man who runs a corporation that messes with peoples personal information)

(Also also, it's pretty freaky to imagine how this could shape the future. With all the movies and media about dystopian futures where poor people scrape enough money to have a few minutes in the ""Simulation"" to feel happy. What if that happens to us? I always thought ""They'll never have the technology to do that, at least, not in my time"". But now, it's right upon us. It really scares me.)","

            ","The quote from the World Economic Forum ""You will own nothing and be happy"", and combine that with the idea of the Metaverse, where, if the worse comes, and you won't need a car, a physical job to go to, or anything really, just an internet connection, a place to be comfy in your home, and of course food and water, which who knows, in the future could be sent to you via a drone or something, kind of makes sense. Of course this is just speculation, but the concept of that is kind of freaky. The idea on paper sounds cool, but in reality, when the technology finally reaches to where the ultimate use of the Metaverse is here, I think that it may have a strongly negative side affect to people's mental and emotional state. Today's social media already has this affect on a lot of people, but this could take that dial up to 11. I think we need to be severely cautious about the Metaverse, despite how cool some of the positive concepts sound.","

            ","One of my biggest issues, All of this stuff already exists. Meta is making it out that they are coming up with something new and revolutionary, However everything they have promised, pretty much already exists within the VR community. Except not controlled by some large Corporation. There's already games, tools and systems where you can meet people in user created worlds (through just an invite) with user created avatars (literally anything you want), where you can meet, hang out, date, play games, work, do art, almost anything. You can already have Hyper realistic Avatar stood next to some Anime looking Avatar and represent yourself how you choose to. 

So in short, as always, the corporations are trying to monopolize an already existing space and make it out that they are the ones coming up with the idea. Just pulling it into one space where they have absolute control to their own benefit. 
I can see how their funding can really push the VR experience further and especially with the tech create some amazing content, i cannot deny this. The quest 2 is already an incredibly cheap and accessible VR kit which competes with top of the range kits. But i think we've all learned many times what happens and is happening when corporations take control of something and the effect  ethically, morally and psychologically.","

            ","This is gonna be a looooong read but probably important for some of the younger audience
I can see the potential of the metaverse in tomorrow's society. Especially the part about ""teleportation"", as it will provide an outlet for several groups of people to experience the world in a new way. Inability to travel? No need...you can do it online. But and this is a huge one...no amount of internet and virtual reality will replace the real world. It can't and it shouldn't. Life isn't perfect and it shouldn't be. Life should have ups and downs, highs and lows in order to experience it fully. People should go out, meet people, get loved, get betrayed. Because that is how they know they are alive. If you are stuck behind a screen or headset, stuck in a world that revolves around what pleases you, you will never have those experiences. Moreover, no amount of teleportation will take away from real travelling. I know that it can be problematic but those few moments where you pose with your friends/family in front of the Niagara Falls or Skogafoss (i think i butchered the name) or that memory of you getting caught in the rain and findin that wonderful restaurant by mistake...those cannot be replaced. 
And on another much more serious note...social media have made us distant from our friends and families. We spent hours upon hours on our phones instead of having a real conversation. I, myself, am guilty of this sometimes, especially now during covid and i communicate a lot more with friends that i would otherwise be meeting. Such a level of distance, where you can phase out in a virtual world, if you don't like being with your friends and family in the moment, will bring our society to an end. Creating this perfect life online will make us hate our real lives. Just imagine what happens at the moment to teenagers because of instagram. They are so unhappy with their lives that some of them fall into depression or, worse, commit suicide. All because of social media and the comparison between our lives and those of other's. Imagine what would happen when you realise that your real life sucks compared to your virtual one. You will want to spent more time there, while letting go of your real life. No exercise, malnourishment (if any nourishment). 
You can not quit social media. You will not cease to exist, but communication with people is not always easy and they make it simple. But do not get sucked into this madness and whatever you use, do it with caution and with a sense of measure. Invest in experiences, not virtual consumable stuff that will likely leave no trace of existence after you use them, leaving you empty. Play videogames with your friends online or by inviting them to your house. Start a conersation about their lives, their wants, needs and dreams. Travel if you can, fly a kite in the middle of the day just because if you so want to, watch a movie with your loved ones, read a book, make memories, live in the moment!","

What then? Perhaps a Facebook owned service that puts your body in a coma, or stasis, situation. Fully hooked up to tubes and the things needed to keep you alive...with the brain fully functional. No need to exercise if you never have to get up.
After that? AI of some sort decides there is no need for the liability of biology at all.","

            ","There's nothing ""new"" about any of this.  Zuckerberg has seen this as the “perfect storm moment” to create a sort of interactive VR version of facebook (I could care less what the marketing folks have decided to label this as), utilizing decades old software and interface concepts, but with modern low cost interface tech and high speed networks that can support this type of mass interactive internet traffic.   What is more interesting than the “metaverse” itself, is how this has suddenly become such a heavily marketed concept.  Clearly the PR people have done an effective job of getting this out to their targeted demographics.
 I personally worked on some interactive 3D internet VR projects, complete with avatars that people could create, and all sorts of elaborate backgrounds and scenarios, entire cities and virtual real estate in the late 1990s (ever hear of AlphaWorld?)..  A programming language for creating 3D interactive VR apps on the internet, VRML, started being developed in the early 00s.  A more recent version of what that basic concept looks like is 2nd Life.","

            ","There's nothing ""new"" about any of this.  Zuckerberg has seen this as the “perfect storm moment” to create a sort of interactive VR version of facebook (I could care less what the marketing folks have decided to label this as), utilizing decades old software and interface concepts, but with modern low cost interface tech and high speed networks that can support this type of mass interactive internet traffic.   What is more interesting than the “metaverse” itself, is how this has suddenly become such a heavily marketed concept.  Clearly the PR people have done an effective job of getting this out to their targeted demographics.
 I personally worked on some interactive 3D internet VR projects, complete with avatars that people could create, and all sorts of elaborate backgrounds and scenarios, entire cities and virtual real estate in the late 1990s (ever hear of AlphaWorld?)..  A programming language for creating 3D interactive VR apps on the internet, VRML, started being developed in the early 00s.  A more recent version of what that basic concept looks like is 2nd Life.","

An avatar can be anything, it doesn't have to be male or female or non binary person, it doesn't have to be identified by gender or species. That is the point of the metaverse, not to be real life but something else where you can be an energy being, or a rock if you want to. And voices can be altered as well, you can sound however you want. 

And to say that someone did something to you that you didn't want, is absolutely absurd. You can log off or even not look at the screen, and voila, nothing is happening.

All adults should be avare of the general toxicity that exists online, and that is nothing new.

People sitting behind a screen are  extremely toxic. So the metaverse will probably not be an exception.

And, to protect children from this new threat, I guess you should just be better parents and actually care about what your child is doing, instead of giving them a device so you can do your own thing and not be bothered.

If it is, then that is reprehensible, and I feel the creators of the game should be made to place restrictions on the game actions. 

Was there no way to move the avatar away from the others,  or to resist or strike back, due to the fact that these are avatars,  computer game pieces, and there is no actual physical restraint involved?  Couldn't you have ""pulled the plug"" on the game and put an end to any action?  You, the human being, always have the option of turning the machines off.  You are not handcuffed or locked into the gaming system against your will---you can escape it at any time, in a single instant.   

I am sorry to break it to you,  boys and girls,  that in any game where there are no rules, no regulations, and no restraints placed on players,  then the ugly side of human nature is certain to show up.  All the more so since in this game, the perpetrators are entirely unknown,  and can suffer no repercussions for their actions. This is the very reason that we have laws and religion in the real world.

And there is nothing unusual in businesses launching a program, a new product or any number of other things, and then acting on problems afterward.  

But seriously,  if you are getting to the point where you are mistaking a ""virtual"" computer gaming world for real life,  to the point were you are ""traumatized""  by something that happens to a picture on a computer screen, then you need to dump the electronics,  turn off the computer,  unplug and go outside into the real world where you can re-acquaint yourself with fresh air,  sunshine and real, living people.

All these consume massive amounts of resources and electricity, an amount that renewable energy is currently still unable to meet, let alone the energy mankind needs for just the basics of daily living.  This will only negate our efforts of reversing climate change and accelerate the death of planet earth, the only place that's capable of supporting human life.","

The physical world would likely become more boring and run down because we care more about the virtual one. And the biggest thing to me is how can you trust what you see and hear is real, it could so easily be manipulated because it already isn't real, see someone harassing someone well that could be deleted and no evidence would be left (though on the other side it may be easier to escape from that situation). Misinformation would be so much easier to create with the virtual world being already fake. Like to me it's just so scary one company would have the power to manipulate what you see and hear, and when this becomes your life well then that's just such a crazy thing to be able to abuse.","

It’s only less known as it’s been not as widely adopted yet because of the costs associated with getting these apps running in multiple headsets concurrently at scale (be that over the cloud or between multiple headsets/PCs in the same room). Even then, as amazing as VR can be - it’s needing the motive to make use of it too - Education, Work, Conferencing, Church and meeting people without borders has all been made possible - but not everything has to be virtual.","

Meta is so far behind its hilarious, but its also scary because now the worlds i have enjoyed for so long are going to turn to meet the trend these companies are going to set.

            ","Even though all these sounds like an episode of Black mirror, we have to understand that no amount of virtual reality can ever overpower the actual physical reality unless the VR has the power to change/modify the physical reality. Let's say for example if you are hungry, virtual food doesn't satisfy your hunger. You need real food (So does the entire ecosystem associated to facilitating it). Another good example would be a medical emergency. If somebody had a heart attack, no VR treatment can save the person if there is no physical treatment. So I wouldn't worry about actual jobs being taken away. We would still need gardeners, doctors, farmers, architects etc. and we would also need everything we have physically today. It will only exist as a social media platform with VR capability and people are not going to be using it 24x7... But I am worried about the psychological impact this platform may create because of the power it offers and how that's going to affect the mental health of people in real life and our future society at large...","

I highly recommend all of you to check out this movie. It's crazy how eerily similar our world would look as compared to the movie with the inevitable advancement of technologies. 

The VR scene alone really was an eye-opener and probably should be a topic up for debate. Given time, there's no doubt that meta will come to feel hyper realistic, the question then is, would people even want to deal with the realities of daily life and the world around them when there's a medium that lets you live out your wildest fantasies no matter how twisted, instantaneously.","

            ","You know… If you think, you are experiencing more in reality than in metaverse. After you hang out with friends in reality, even if it was just a simple conversation , you have a feeling of satisfaction and happiness , but after metaverse, it’s nothing. There are emotions, but seconds after you take of your helmet, you are alone, you start to remember that it was not real and the emptiness returns, no, you just see it again. And you either take of your helmet and feel the void, or stay in illusion and die… I mean, literally, you need to eat.
On the other side, it would make a good effect on environment and while in simulation people would cover the void with picture, people who won’t use metaverse would make memories and live their live. It won’t be filled with monster fights, but every moment would be real.
If you read to this moment, please, go outside. Feel the touch of grass, soil, snow, leaves, sand or whatever is covering your ground. Admire the beauty of our world. Do some exercise.  Find new friends or hang out with old ones. 
Love today, and seize all tomorrows.","

It started as an experiment where rich investors got to live on a fully autonomous and sustainable floating country-city-island-ship in the Pacific Ocean. Most people lived in tiny windowless cubes while connected 24/7 to the virtual world.

People started losing touch with reality and themselves, and all hell broke lose when the virtual world got hacked. Everyone aboard the island thought a massive hurricane was approaching so they defensively activated a powerful energy device which almost started a nuclear war with the US who thought it was an attack against them!

            ","I Don't believe that having a virtual world, earing there and buying there would be enough. Just because we can teleport in the metaverse doesn't mean we don't we don't need cars. 

We as humans are real people and we need physical goods to survive. People need food and to buy groceries or a trip to a cafe we need cars. (Yes there is online shopping but some people just prefer to do it physically) eating food in the virtual world won't end the hunger of real bodies. You get sick, u need to go to hospitals physically here again a talk about transportation. You got an ache u need a physical massage, a physically applied lotion to your skin and a physically done hair or nails.  And people need physical cash to get these done so they gotta work as well. So these things especially transport (since he mentions them a lot), aren't just magically gonna disappear just because there is a metaverse.
