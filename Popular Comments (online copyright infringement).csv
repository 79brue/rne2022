            ","Another tip i learnt is to always document your production processes....either by video or photos. Either upload photos to an online place (instagram or email), or upload a process video to YouTube (public or private). Somewhere with a legit date stamp.
I will say that when i was in undergrad and was learning graphic design, i did trace low rez works for projects if they were not 'high quality' enough for me. So i could argue that i created the work because i had 'proof' that I created them, because...well, I did, however the idea was never mine. But, i was aware of copyright laws/rules, but i also knew they were simply for class. So yeah. So please document your process and upload.

Also, another thing you could consider regarding watermarks.....I usually include my signature/name HIDDEN WITHIN the artwork as PART OF THE ART (whether drawing art or photography). This signature within NEVER goes away. You could try that. I assume it will help a lot if someone does recreate your work, and if you never uploaded the processes before they did.
Good luck to all of us.","

When entering the mod's website, it redirected to a landing page. That landing page had a statement, something like ""Warning! Representatives or agents of Funimation, Cartoon Network or [various entities with the broadcasting rights to Dragonball Z] ARE NOT AUTHORIZED to access this website!""

I know this is part of the art business, having to deal with copyright infringement or others trying to make a buck off hard working artists.

            ","If anyone could give me their input on my dilemma, your advice is appreciated.

Also, I planned to sell on my own website, not Etsy. :)

I want to start a small business selling “fan designed” anime fashion to contribute pride and confidence to the anime community. It’s not just about making some extra money from a side hustle. I want to expand the anime fashion experience, so fans can be proud to express anime culture.

I don’t want to “drop-ship” shirts that are already made. I want to design my own graphics in my own art style/theme. I don’t condone in art theft, so I’ll never steal official art works and slap it on a shirt. And I, of course, won’t claim the character or show they come from.

I was so excited to start planning out this business and getting around to design some clothes, but these copyright laws are preventing me from doing so. I don’t want to waste time, energy, and money solidifying my business only to risk getting sued for copyright infringement in the future.

I’ve recently started thinking about copyright laws surrounding selling anime merchandise, so I’m quite ignorant on this matter. I know the straightforward answer would be: just don’t do it. But want to give back to the community I grew up in. And share my fashion and art to people who will appreciate it. 

My research on this matter has been fruitless. 

Most results say to reach out to the companies/owners of the anime to gain permissions to use the assumed-copyrighted-characters. But that’s usually to resell (drop-ship) merchandise from other stores. 

And other results talk about the legality of selling fanart. Which, in a way, has some relevance to my problem. But it still isn’t really helpful since an art print is obviously different than a shirt or hoodie.

How are these other small online businesses selling their “hand designed” merch without getting sued for copyright infringement? (Ex: HYPLAND, Sugoi Mode, etc.) I know that these businesses don’t need to prove that they have a license to sell their anime merch, but still...

You’ve made it to the end of my LONG comment. Thank you so much for taking the time to read it. Your help, input, and advice is gratefully appreciated.","

I guess I didn't really purchase anything.  I like how that was never once made clear to me up front and pretty sure it constitutes false advertising/bait and switch which are illegal.  Same goes for movies.  Stuff you bought on streaming services isn't really yours.  All this is why I only purchase DVD, Blu-ray or CDs.  You truly own them if you can get at the content on the discs and do what you want with it.  Suddenly I don't feel bad about ""piracy"" aka freely using the things I paid for.

            ","Very interesting video !!!
But i still have question regarding the parameters of copyright and patent process.
I am a leather jacket manufacturer and have my own jacket factory but i am really confused regarding the jacket styles.
For example my biker leather jacket design looks same as 100s of other biker jackets from different companies. So my question is: Can a generic deisgn be patented of copyrighted. For example evry t-shirt in the world has a round neck deisgn, so can a company go and get a patent for round neck design to stop other companies to manufacture round neck t-shirts? Please note im not taking about the brand name or any specific pattern or deisgn on the t-shirt but i am taking about the basic design in clothing. 
I get inspiration from a lot of online leather jackets and i want to make the same designs in my factory but obviously without the pattern or label of the company from whose website i am getting the design ideas.
Thank you in advance","

I don't advocate that people infringe on anyone's work. I find it immoral as well as illegal. However, groups that copy and distribute copyright material would just jump ship and go to a country that has no or limited laws regarding infringement. Just going after the downloader is not enough. They have to go after the uploaders of this content. Stop those people and the rest will take care of itself. No distributors, less downloaders.

            ","on 4:20, the disclaimer about association. Obviously this relates to trademark protection, rather than copyright protection. 

I think the clear separation on this channel between intellectual property protection through copyright law (fair use, derivative work, etc) and intellectual property protection through trademark law (consumer misleading, usage of images associated with original holder) is somewhat incorrect. A lot of times you can infringe on someone's trademark, without infringing on their copyright or while using their copyrights fairly, and vice versa. And this merits a dismissal (this has nothing to do with copyrights) but rather how does this relate to the problem this disclaimer is trying to address (nobody would really think you are party of the Disney channel)?","

Also, as far as selling high-res images, you can have a contract stating that the image purchased may only be used for the purpose intended for a set amount of time, so for the yearbook example, she could've had the contract say that the panther image may only be used for a yearbook cover for that school for that year.

So, my archive of artwork is lots of other creator's characters reinterpreted in my drawings. Would using my artwork on business cards be seen as copyright infringement because of the other creator's characters?","

            ","I have spent ALL Day here on YouTube & online trying desperately to find a SOLID/100% Answer about ""fair use,"" copyright Laws, & what not; when making videos on here. While your video here didn't give me an Answer, hell, it Was the most Coherent, made the most sense, & you addressed many things I'd already thought of; as far as putting a disclaimer at the start of a video someone makes w/copywritten music/photos/videos/ect. being meaningless in the OVER-Convoluted ""laws.""

But DO you have an answer or Explanation on How millions & millions of videos that still are on here/have been for Years that DO use a Lot of various copy written media in Specifically Documentary videos or documentary-esque videos. I wish to create video content (without wanting Any Money.) just for the sake of more artistic videos, discussing various Mediums of art; but Do feel my ideas wouldn't work without showing photos, playing song clips, showing video clips from film, & so on. I do Not intend to make ""reaction"" videos, or other ""documentary"" type videos, some which flat out Slander huge artists' names in these videos.

A good example would be the Vast number of (often absurd) ""illuminati/exposed/ect"" videos that show video clips, play music & call artists vulgar names/flat out Slander & attack whatever artist in question in outrageous ways. (yet play Long, DEF longer than 30 sec. of their music/videos/photo shoots/art/ect.,while doing so.. ??) That is just an example I've seen MUCH of over the Years, where FULL music videos or songs (or even official images of), regardless of the copywritten clips being Semi-""chopped up."" Some of those videos I just find entertaining humorously honestly & others even if I'm Not a fan or not, of the artist being Attacked: HOW Are these videos up all these Years without any repercussions?! Or just the Millions-PLUS of ""reaction"" videos, where the Majority of a huge artists' new music video is Shown AND Played, as people comment on said video; even if they Pause the copywritten material time to time. Just a couple of EXAMPLES I see/have seen for Years.

I personally do NOT Wish to make either of those types of videos, I suppose you could call what I have in mind somewhat more ""critical analysis"" of musicians, filmmakers, modern painters/artists, authors, ect; just Many different Art Mediums I intend to discuss my Various Opinions on. (& TRY to do this in a Non-Typical ""art reviewer"" manner; though I suppose that's what I wish to do to a Certain Extent..) But I don't wish to just stare at a webcam, without Showing some Clips of said artists work, despite the medium..I mean exactly How can I review/discuss/ect a post-modern painters' work without Showing some of their art, if just a Second or 2.,you know? But yet Again, over Years I see videos of all types, where artists paintings/music/ect. are shown. Or even Many 30+ min. analysis of a huge film, where said video Shows & Plays a LOT of footage.

So with all these supposed IRON CLAD Copy write LAWS, that to me Seem to be being Broken by just Random art critics (I'm not speaking of Complex News or something like that, where Many artists' labels/ect have made Deals in order to Promote said artists..), who are Just random YouTubers who don't work for Any company. The MASSIVE YouTube channel ""theneedledrop,"" which I myself have watched for years; reviews Music for example. The man who does reviews of music records has Always is able to Visually Show the record COVER in each video review. Yes, he is Much more popular now than say back a decade or so ago; but That has Always been the Same. But I looked up just what Images I am LEGALLY Allowed to show in a video, Most ALL record/cd/LP Covers are listed as Copywritten Material, that I Could be sued for using in my own videos if I chose to. How Does that make SENSE? I realize I have typed MUCH here..I myself Am an artist who HAS Had my Own Original work (drawings & paintings; though I practice multiple artistic Mediums..like writing; hense the length of this..) flat out Stolen & unless I wished to hire a lawyer, which I did/do not have the Funds for; I couldn't do shit about it. I've accepted that & now know to just use watermarks; which I feel ""takes away"" from the piece of art in a way; but Online Art Thieves are ruthless. I though DO NOT wish to STEAL any other artists' work here; just analyze & so on, in I suppose a ""documentary"" type way (but it's not Exactly ""documentary"" I have in mind..it's hard to explain, without me writing Even More here..)

BUT, as your video made the Most sense of all the Many others on here:
Am I just fucked as far as wishing to use Tiny Blips of Copywritten content for my videos' purpose (that MILLIONS of Others do in their videos, with NO repercussions..), but I'll just end up screwed over?..Or is there a Proper WAY to make such videos you are aware of in a LAWFUL Manner? Do you Know HOW Exactly do these VAST Number of other videos get away with showing such content without Any issue? As I said, I do Not wish to make money, become ""YouTube-famous,"" or AnyThing like that!! This is just..um, the Best way I can put it is it's more ""an art project"" to ME, but I won't waste Hours of Time working hard to create what I Hope to be interesting/thought provoking content on All art mediums, only to have my videos deleted or at worst sued/ect.
So this comment may have not even been read due to the massive length, but if it actually was: IS THERE A 100% ANSWER HERE? HOW are Certain video uploaders Huge AND Tiny ABLE to get away with things OTHERS (also Huge & Tiny) get banned/ect for? Is this just an uphill battle I'll Never win or even Understand, due to HOW CONVOLUTED these Laws Are. As I said, I'm an artist of multiple mediums myself & have Ambitiously Tried for YEARS to create Innovative Art, but the Art Industry typically (MOST of the time; unless your're a senator's kid or something like that..) doesn't CARE about creativity/innovation/ect; ONLY Money in MOST Cases; which I HAVE dealt with many Corporations in the past. I just Assumed YouTube was different. ;/ Is there a REAL Legal Answer(s) here or are all artists (without some HUGE Connection(s)) born after a certain year, like myself just Fucked. I cannot even make video content analyzing other artists/their work NOW!? If you (or Anyone Sincere, who isn't just going to bitch about how much I type..) actually have ANY advice or answers here, I'd greatly Appreciate it. Thanks. (& Sorry for any typos, but I'm not doing a collage essay here..)

            ","Hi, I wanted to say this was a excellent video that clearly helps understand each individual part of the form. KUDOS to that !! And it’s much appreciated.

But I did want to say that I have triple verified (music lawyer, website instructions and talked to representative at copyright office) that when someone is the sole author/claimant and wants to register the copyrights of all 3 - musical composition, lyrics and the sound recording, that you can use the SR form. Within that form is a place to say what your the author of and you add lyrics and music there along with the sound recording too obviously.

It actually clearly lets you know this with these instructions on the SR form on the website: “Form SR should be used when the copyright claim is limited to the sound recording itself, *and it may also be used where the same copyright claimant is seeking simultaneous registration of the underlying musical, dramatic, or literary work embodied in the phono-record.”*

So I was just curious if you knew this already and is there a legitimate legal reason why you feel it’s inadaquate ? Or is this just simply something you didn’t know ? I’d like to know before I move forward as it would be so much easier for me to do them all on one form because my songs are all final mastered and done and owned by me. But I don’t want to make a mistake.","

            ","Austin sings this song with such emotion, there’s almost a cry in his voice. And, as you said, vulnerability. I love the ambient music track int the background they Seby put together…I think it adds almost a haunting feeling. As always I loved your reaction.","

            ","This video was extremely helpful!! 
So  when you do the copyright application for your song can you go ahead and release the song same day or same week or do you have to give it time or wait?? I’m really new to all this music copyrights and stuff.  Also what other legal things should I take care of before releasing a song or album (copyright, registering song)?? I have no idea what I’m doing so anything helps!","

            ","I thought copyright lasted either 120 years since creation or 95 years after publication (whichever ends first). Yet now it’s 70 years after the death of the author. 
It used to be 75 years after publication but that was changed in the 1990s to 95 years after publication. 
Now it’s 70 years after the author’s death which is likely even longer than 95 years after publication.
It seems that every time we are getting close to have new stuff in the public domain they change the copyright laws to keep it out of the public domain. 
And I think the 70 years after the death of the author is actually a lot more messy than 95 years after publication.
What if there are multiple creators? Do we need to wait for every child actor to be dead for 70 years until a movie enters the public domain?
Why not keep it simple and go by publication date?
99,99 % of creators don’t need to worry about outliving their copyright if we  go by 95 years after publication. 
So what’s the use of this change?
Star Wars would have started to enter the public domain in 2073 with the whole of pre Disney content (the EU) being in the public domain by the year 2111.

And who even is considered the creator of content belonging to a franchise like Star Trek or Star Wars. I mean Gene Roddenberry has been dead for more than 30 years but I don’t think TNG will be in the public domain in 2060 since it continued even after Roddenberry died.

And George Lucas had very little to do with the EU content of Star Wars. So how many people need to be dead for 70 years for something like the Dark Forces/Jedi Knight series to enter the public domain?
It’s just so confusing now.","
